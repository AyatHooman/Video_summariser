1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
So you need a A classes with us.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,759
Now that he's missed the first class,

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,759
we only have seven classes with him.

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
But don't think that you have that much contact time.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,560
Contact time is actually very little.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,640
You're expected to do much of the eating yourself

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
and ask questions during class.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
Last week, they almost seemed like one way

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,760
traffic I was doing most of the talking.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,240
There wasn't anything coming back.

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,639
And I think encourage you to do more talking as well.

12
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,039
Because then I know what you know and what you don't know.

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,799
If you hit quiet, I don't know what you know.

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,599
Now during the course of this year,

15
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:43,439
you'll notice that cluster 9A project

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,320
called the Stink Holden engagement and business risk.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,119
Please notice that set.

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,039
In that set, I do know teaching.

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm here to support your learning.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,079
What we've done is we've actually bought course material

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,079
from a company and it's run as a computer package.

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,200
You have to work your way through the computer package

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,640
and then submit the work.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,719
And then obviously the computer, I will mark some parts of it.

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,879
But the computer package will do most of the marketing.

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,480
But during that time, you wonder,

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,560
so what do you do for the four weeks or five weeks

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,680
that the unit is running?

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,519
What will you be doing?

30
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,480
How we teaching you building?

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,120
See the board over there and the board in the corner over there?

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,520
I will be standing there and I'll be working you

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,200
through the entire building process.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,280
This was a suggestion by one of the previous generations

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,680
of students because he found that to be very honest,

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,760
everyone is going to run a project differently.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,920
And the unit doesn't actually apply

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,719
to building a construction.

39
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,400
It's a general business unit.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,159
Look at the title in the front.

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
It says BSB, not CPC.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,680
So it's not a construction topic.

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
It's run as a business topic.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,840
All of us will run businesses differently.

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,599
The way we run a building with construction business

46
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,920
will depend on three things.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,719
The amount of money you have,

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,120
the question of whether you can do any of the work

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,520
in yourself or are you an armchair builder?

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,080
The third thing that will affect you really

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,000
is the distance from you to the job site.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
So the way that you manage your businesses,

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
or your construction projects,

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,680
will all vary between us.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,400
Your appetite for risk will also adjust it

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,880
to make all things that you need.

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,160
So I'll be very honest with you.

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,880
There's nothing I can do about project management

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,480
and project quality.

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
Those things are things that you believe in

61
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,079
and you go and carry out.

62
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,039
I don't want to throw smoke in your face.

63
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,399
I'd rather teach you subjects

64
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,239
that I have a clear understanding about

65
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,359
and I know what I'm talking about.

66
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,000
So similar to what the senior students know about me by now,

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,679
the new ones among you will realize this.

68
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,239
If I don't know something, I'm not going to throw smoke.

69
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,199
If I know something, I speak very authoritatively about it.

70
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,439
I'm not being arrogant.

71
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,519
It's because I know what I'm talking about.

72
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,719
If I don't know something, I'll tell you I don't know something.

73
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,239
Very different from something.

74
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,000
So hopefully you're aware of that.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,719
So let's get back to class.

76
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,159
Last week, we covered 5011 and we covered

77
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,000
most of the crap.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
Again, we're doing the scroll of death

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
to all the rest of the slides.

80
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,680
By the way, when you went home, you got access to my slide.

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
When you went through the slides,

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,399
were there anything that you want to wear,

83
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:53,639
weren't happy about, still understanding about,

84
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,000
the last week we went through 5011,

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,399
which had the four elements, we covered element one,

86
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,560
which is to prepare an organizational environmental

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,719
management.

88
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,120
The funny thing that I realized is that many of you

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
have never done this before.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,199
So what I did when I went home was I went to look for all the links

91
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,120
and I simplified it.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,519
So if you go to your learning portal,

93
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,039
you'll notice that in the corner there's this thing called

94
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,360
supplementary learner support.

95
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,480
There are four new links there.

96
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,920
The first one is the EPS guide for the construction industry

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,040
of our environmental guidance.

98
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,439
The next three links give you what I could find online

99
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,720
by councils.

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
So remember in class, I mentioned KC council

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
because most of your course mates

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,360
and me from the previous generations

103
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,639
have been using the KC council's environmental management

104
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,479
plan template to be able to prepare

105
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,919
an environmental management plan.

106
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,279
I found a couple of others.

107
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,759
So the Mitchell Shire also has one and Melbourne Water

108
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
also provides one.

109
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,479
What you can do is obviously click on that

110
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,879
to take you to the link and allow you to open

111
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,519
guidance notes and also the template document.

112
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,319
All the EMPs tend to look roughly the same.

113
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,319
We tend to look something like this.

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,759
It always has a section.

115
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,839
Anyone got the microphone on?

116
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,479
I don't like listening to myself.

117
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,479
I like to be close.

118
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,839
I don't like listening to some of my own boys.

119
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,639
Right.

120
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
So coming back to this,

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,919
all the templates have opened them up.

122
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,399
They roughly roughly the same like that.

123
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,479
But what's key that you tend to see is that

124
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,719
you tend to have a large space where you can draw

125
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,759
in your protection measures.

126
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,399
It also asks you about who has the management responsibility.

127
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,279
So now you'll understand why the next unit that's

128
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,719
in this class, the top's about management.

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,720
That's why there was a natural link between the two.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Hopefully you see that when it comes to you.

131
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,720
And a lot of the environmental effects affect the safety

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
of the people on the construction site.

133
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
That's right.

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Anyway, so you have to fill out this form.

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Right.

136
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
All of them come in this same form.

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Why is this important?

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Your second assessment pass in the unit

139
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,720
requires you to prepare a fictitious.

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,720
If you have it, if you have a proper job site,

141
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
you can wait for that.

142
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,720
But if not, you have to prepare a fictitious environmental

143
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
management plan.

144
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,720
So using a template like this and the guidance note

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,720
that prepared by the various councils and also authorities

146
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
will help you prepare this.

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll just go through the different sections.

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
So if you've got any questions, please feel free to ask.

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,720
So first of all, you have state who are the people responsible for the job.

150
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Can anyone figure out why the engineers crucial at this stage,

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,720
although I keep telling you who is the full control of a building site?

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Who is the person conducting the business undertaking me, the builder, you, the builder?

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Right.

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Why is the consulting engineer or the civil contractor relevant to the individual?

155
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Reloven to this.

156
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Because the digging that you do on the site, remember I showed you a slide last week

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
of what the engineers are looking into their plans.

158
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,720
The digging that you do on site these days are prescribed by the engineer.

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
They tell you how to do it.

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,720
The civil contractor is the person that carries out most of the underground living.

161
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Most construction work these days were to types,

162
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,720
storm detention systems that run underground.

163
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
So they are the ones that did the job.

164
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,720
It is imperative that we know who put what under the ground.

165
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
And why is it when something happens?

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
They are responsible very much well.

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
So remember my point at the past, right?

168
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Whoever you hired to do the job for, make sure they are registered in my sense.

169
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Because if not, it falls back on.

170
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
You can see now how the responsibility is done.

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Now, who is the emergency contact?

172
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
The builder.

173
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
That's all you can't get away from that.

174
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,720
How do you communicate your EMP requirements?

175
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It has to be done using an induction.

176
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Now, I know you once have seen building sites in some cases where you don't see.

177
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Builders actually properly in ductile workers, especially because workers or subcontractors

178
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
that we use frequent job sites.

179
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,720
You may not be for that job site, but because we've got a long standing relationship within.

180
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
You think there's no need to induct them.

181
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
They know what to do.

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,720
On the other hand, can I point out to you if there is a safety breach on your site,

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
something goes wrong.

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,720
The first thing that the EPA or anyone will ask for,

185
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,720
works safe is another authority that will look for it.

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,720
They'll ask for all your induction sheets.

187
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Now, you have to display the EMP in a visible location.

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that I do that myself.

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Most of the time, it's in the bundle right at the back of the working drawings.

190
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Remember, you need a copy of a building permit.

191
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
And all of your working drawings on site.

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,720
So, usually this will find its way to the back of that.

193
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't display nobody displacing.

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
So, I hate to tell you this, right?

195
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
As a teacher, I'm supposed to teach you the right thing,

196
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
but you can see that on a normal job site, nobody requires it.

197
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
If you think about the inspectors that come true and ask you where is your EMP,

198
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
why is it a display?

199
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
You have showed them the bundle.

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
You still get our trouble.

201
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm telling you that from personal experience.

202
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Inspections and maintenance, you need two inspections per week.

203
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Now, does any builder actually go through the two inspections per week?

204
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
No. But if you are a builder and you are on site every day,

205
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,720
you can give the excuse that you do your inspection every day.

206
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Now, the requirement is for you to walk through twice a week.

207
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,720
The number of people that do it, zero to none, I'll be very honest.

208
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Mostly, you'll see the inspection people will be safety officers,

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,720
and that is a much larger building infrastructure.

210
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,720
So, remember, this EMP isn't just used by you, the home builder, right?

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,720
It's also used by commercial construction.

212
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Inspect prior to an afterstorm event.

213
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
That's just a reminder for you.

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Most of the time in the construction stage, most problems start to occur after reading.

215
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Maintenance required with all rectification to be addressed within 12 hours of the incident report.

216
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Now, can I point out, it does say that it is rectified in the sheet.

217
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Most of the time, we'll see if EPA will be pretty happy with you if you start to take action.

218
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,720
You need to show that you take action within 12 hours.

219
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,720
For staging of the works.

220
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Now, what the staging of the works mean.

221
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
When you have a construction site, you will realize that you're site fencing.

222
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,720
You'll have all of the other precautionary items that you have on site when you start the job.

223
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
That might include site signage.

224
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
That might also include lighting.

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Depending on the size of the job in your requirements.

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
So that's your staging of the works.

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,720
You can put a short description in there about the items that you've carried out to prepare the job site for the job at hand.

228
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Next, informing the residents.

229
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Now, this is something that I see very few builders do.

230
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I, on the other hand, can I point out I have a job site at the moment.

231
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Every neighbor in all four directions, most of them, and most how to contact them.

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,720
You will find one thing when you come up.

233
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
There are two schools of thoughts in this.

234
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
One is if the neighbor actually knows you.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Some of you get very bothered by the fact.

236
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Sorry, just let me start.

237
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
George, what are you doing there?

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Yeah, you've very completed this unit really.

239
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Yeah, now I'm here.

240
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
There's a light class.

241
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
No, there's no surveying class.

242
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,720
The surveying class runs every Wednesday night.

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Online.

244
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Okay, I know how precious your time is.

245
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,720
So for the new students, I hope you recognize this over time.

246
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I know all my students.

247
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,720
I take personal responsibility for all of you.

248
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Okay, I see your face and I know whether the person is completed.

249
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
This one is no line.

250
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
This is demonstrated to you straight away.

251
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Okay.

252
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,720
And George Hartney comes to class.

253
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Right.

254
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Now, there's two schools of thought about informing your residents.

255
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
The first school of thought is this.

256
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,720
If you inform your residents who you are, some builders feel that the residents may take advantage of you.

257
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Any single problem.

258
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,720
They're going to pick up the phone and call Irving.

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
My fans have fallen over.

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Irving, there's water running down the drive. Irving, there's this.

261
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Now, what school of thought do you belong to?

262
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I rather than then the resident doesn't know me.

263
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
And what do you think happens next?

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Hello, council.

265
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
The builder next door is doing this.

266
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
The builder next door is doing that.

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
What happens next?

268
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I get fine.

269
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
So you pick which school of thought you want to follow.

270
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Remember, again, I'm going to repeat this again and again.

271
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Irving teaches both sides of the point.

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I never tell you my ways, right?

273
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I tell you what's the alternate this way.

274
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You decide what is right.

275
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Because remember, you as a builder, you play with your company's money, your clients money and your own families money, you decide.

276
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
So I'll leave it at that.

277
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Right.

278
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,720
You inform residents to give them the sense of comfort that the someone that will respond to their needs.

279
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Now, picture yourself as the builder on site.

280
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
But also picture yourself as a home owner.

281
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Imagine if the next door neighbor stopped building.

282
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Now, as builders, I have a, I would say I have a longer patient string.

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,720
My string will run longer because.

284
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Because I'm a builder myself.

285
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
So I give them a bit of slack in the sense.

286
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
But on the other hand, most people are not builders.

287
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
They don't recognize the fact that the job site is going through a life.

288
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Where it's going through a pile of mess.

289
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,720
And then it gets cleaned up.

290
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,720
And some people believe in their rights are strong.

291
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,720
So I cannot advise you what's the best thing.

292
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
You decide what's best for yourself.

293
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Next one, six, your associated documents.

294
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Obviously that will include things like your site plan, your induction sheets, your safety plans.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Who, if you have a contact list that you put up as well, those will all be part of your associated documents.

296
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Right. The EPS guidance note also from part of that.

297
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:59,720
The other thing that you could think of that could also go into your associated documents is that if you do use any form of environmental pollution prevention kids.

298
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,720
For example, the same begging, for example, the wind nets, for example, you know, cross over.

299
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Protections to, you know, rumble off the tires to make sure that the mud doesn't spread to the street.

300
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:22,720
If you have any of those, if there's a manufacturer's ship that describes how it's supposed to be used, you could put it into this associated documents as well.

301
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
But those are you sitting down and just listening to me.

302
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I hope it's all going in.

303
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm really concerned that when it comes to the time of you doing your assessment task, you will find an issue.

304
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Right. This forms part of your assessment task.

305
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
So one thing you could do is to download a copy of this onto your computer now.

306
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
And as I'm talking, you type it in.

307
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
And then you've got a submission.

308
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
You don't even have to prepare for it.

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
At the time, you have a draft.

310
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
I know I have a draft.

311
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,720
You don't have access to that. Why don't I give you a wet link? It looks easier that way.

312
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Yeah, with your case, I'm going to start writing it down.

313
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Yeah, I would suggest you actually type it.

314
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Everyone at home still okay.

315
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Sorry, I hope you understand why I'm sitting down.

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
For those of you who are here.

317
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Yeah, give you KC's one.

318
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:24,720
You can go through and look through all the rest of them as well and see which one you hope you for the years.

319
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Right.

320
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,720
So complaining about the fact you don't have access.

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,720
The only thing I can suggest to all of you and I'm saying this.

322
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,720
From the bottom of my heart, please complain.

323
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Complain to the school. Just keep calling keep complaining.

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
You know what will happen? The complaints will come back to us again.

325
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
And once it becomes too much, my head of school statement.

326
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,720
So my point is to.

327
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Let's keep throwing as much as you can.

328
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
No, but last time you didn't have a problem right?

329
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Everything was fine right?

330
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
The school to back.

331
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
There's a quiet.

332
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,720
You need to log into.

333
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah, for your attendance.

334
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,720
You need to log into teams or attendants is on the screen of your check.

335
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Okay. So for those of you at home or here.

336
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Seriously download a copy while I'm talking through just time.

337
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Some not seen use a different color font.

338
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
And you've now got the answers for what you.

339
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Or part of the answers you need to submit for your assessment pass.

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Because you always find it really hard at the end of the two years.

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Right.

342
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Seven.

343
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,720
So most of the time we have normal working hours that run between seven a.m.

344
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
And 60 m.

345
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Right.

346
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Because there's obviously a certain noise control requirement.

347
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Outside of those hours for weekends is between seven and one.

348
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Right on a Sunday.

349
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Seriously, you shouldn't be working.

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I know some builders still try and get away from it.

351
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
But you shouldn't start until after nine.

352
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Another place you can consult.

353
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
For these kind of information is the council.

354
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Right.

355
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Normal working hours for construction.

356
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Your local council will tell you what is acceptable.

357
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
You'll find the different councils because of the demographics that are there.

358
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
We'll have different requirements.

359
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,720
For example, please do not use Melbourne city council to apply their timings.

360
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
To say white horse.

361
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,720
You need to obviously in eight.

362
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
You need to minimize noise.

363
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
There are many ways of minimizing noise.

364
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
The most recent one is that most of our tools are getting softer.

365
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,720
If you notice most tools these days, especially in Milwaukee.

366
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,720
They've launched a new range of tools that are quieter than average.

367
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Power to.

368
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,720
But most of us won't go out and sell our tools and start buying.

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
I think keeping to your timing is most important.

370
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
The.

371
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Most of the time on the job site, I'd say the loudest noise tends to be.

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
The workers putting on the radio.

373
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
That's the most.

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Intrusive.

375
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Please remember if you do run the job site that may be babies living next door and whatnot.

376
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
They need an afternoon nap.

377
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Alright, so he's team careful about these things.

378
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Yeah.

379
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,720
So next door neighbor.

380
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Is complaining that you know.

381
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
And they.

382
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
They just in game.

383
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
For noise.

384
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
No.

385
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,720
For noise usually the complain and you get a fine if it's found that you are.

386
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Too noisy.

387
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Now you have to be the reason you're able to make noise because it's after all construction site.

388
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,720
If you want to try to find a way to minimize noise further, you can put up a sound barrier.

389
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Right, which is essentially a.

390
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Scafu of sorts with with with a solid.

391
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Carp on one side that prevents noise from transmitting across.

392
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,720
By the same time they have to understand that the job site you won't get fined by the.

393
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Your noises within.

394
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Carried by I think it's 67 decibels.

395
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Right.

396
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,720
You can always download a decibel.

397
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,720
I hope to see what kind of noise you generate.

398
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,720
You can take the measurement from the site boundary fence, not next to the machine.

399
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Then you're afraid.

400
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
And.

401
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
That's one.

402
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
And.

403
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
And.

404
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,720
And.

405
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
And.

406
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
And.

407
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
And.

408
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
And.

409
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
And.

410
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
And.

411
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
And.

412
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,720
If you are going on international travel, if you want to.

413
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
I think that was the right.

414
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Last night.

415
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Be sure you're gone.

416
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Sure.

417
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
So within reason you can make the night.

418
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Now, obviously, you got the other considerations of your V key kilo movements as well.

419
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I read brought up this example in past two weeks ago about you building near the schools.

420
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Consider what the school.

421
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Drop off and pick up times up.

422
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
And.

423
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,720
You also affect your overall cost of operation.

424
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Because it's a certain time to me to start.

425
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
What do you do?

426
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
There była small little bit on the right hand corner.

427
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,720
This is risk significant media.

428
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Now, this.

429
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,720
This one will require a bit of building language.

430
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Depends on the kind of construction we're doing.

431
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:17,200
that much more to be very honest. On the other hand, piling work, jack hammering, doing large

432
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:26,720
concrete floors may generate a lot of knowledge. So you have to look at the kind of work you carry out

433
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:33,120
before you can decide whether it's low risk, high risk or significance or a medium or more.

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,119
So consideration requires some building knowledge. You need to know what kind of cost you're

435
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,159
carrying out, what kind of tools and the amount of noise they generate. In case you don't realize if

436
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,119
you look at your books or tools whenever you buy tools from a heater, Milwaukee, the wall,

437
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,119
there's always a sheet inside that's the owner's manual but it also tells you on the owner's manual

438
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:02,639
how much noise it generates. It gives you a decibel reading. And the normal news.

439
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,759
That should be your first stop in case the EPS, you have much noise, you're generating.

440
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:14,160
The second thing is obviously your trustee iPhone. You can always install a decibel reader into it.

441
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,480
You know, give you a pretty good result. Remember when you run your decibel reader, your iPhone,

442
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,520
you have to take off the cover. It doesn't come naturally to you.

443
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,840
Next thing, dust. Again, there's a risk factor in the middle of low. Again, look at the work that you're

444
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:40,159
carrying out. Look at what kind of dust it means to generate. Now in that dust bit, remember a lot of

445
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:47,919
dust tends to happen during demolition work, especially when ticking down walls. Now most of the time

446
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,720
with timber, it doesn't generate that much dust. Most timber dust tends to fall apart.

447
00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:00,000
At this point in time, other kinds of dust that generated things like cutting of tiles, cutting of

448
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,119
cement, sheet and whatnot, in the old days, they used to be stone bench tops that were so cut on

449
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,240
site. But as all of you know, that is now banned. Okay, so you don't see so much of that.

450
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,640
So for dust suppression, you need to keep the dust down. The common method tends to be the use of

451
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,720
water. So there should be always running water on the dust site. Now in case you don't realize it

452
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,839
or you don't work with construction, remember before you start any construction work, what is the

453
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:37,360
primary need on the job site? You need a running pet. Is there a need for a site toilet?

454
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:51,839
No. And the start of any normal domestic building job when there's no construction in that sense,

455
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,439
you're just digging up the ground. There is no need for a toilet. There was no requirement for that.

456
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:03,759
So there's a need for running water all kinds of toilet. If you do not have running water on the site,

457
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,000
you do not intend to put on running water on your site, get to know your neighbors.

458
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,799
And just tell them, in case there's an emergency, I'll come over and use the water. Would you like to

459
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,399
charge me for it? Trust me, it's still less expensive than you installing the water that

460
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,680
is effective to 45. Just so you know.

461
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
Assessment, that is…

462
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:41,359
...

463
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,359
Is that a photo?

464
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,599
Do you actually say cutting pile is in your goal length.

465
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,399
So actually what is cutting pile?

466
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:56,679
It'sed in babies!

467
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,719
You can cut it in your place.

468
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,319
outside the water coming out. Oh no then that's fine yeah you need to have

469
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,799
all the questions stick them first. In the old days when I was in a

470
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,559
practice can I tell you my Tyler just cut cows on the side of the footpath

471
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,880
no protection nothing warm no water nothing just cut sick. I still can't see

472
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,720
some people doing. So that's illegal right that if you get seen you get fine

473
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,680
quite heavily. So some of you may listen to me online or here in class and go

474
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,120
but I don't think we still see happening remember if you don't get caught

475
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,400
you know if you go right that's fine. It's hard to look around. Is it

476
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,960
is it a crime to shop lift? Why don't you ask movies and calls how much shop

477
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:52,039
listing goes on. Yeah they can't do anything about it right but shop listing

478
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,519
occurs. You know what's the fine thing about shop listing that I also found out recently

479
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,759
because one of my boys got done for shop listings okay. Do you want to shop

480
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:06,759
list more than $50 worth? Keep your shop listing under $50. They'll only

481
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,200
take the item from you to give you a warning.

482
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:18,039
I asked me under $50 the moment you cross a hundred dollars what happened.

483
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,839
No you don't get they counted you to the cops they don't want to take you to the

484
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,839
cops because it's bad for publicity for them right. What happens is that they

485
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:32,279
ban you from the store. So you ban from going into any so let's say you

486
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,920
let's see you shop this something from goodies. You take more than $100 worth of items from

487
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:44,440
rulers you can't go into any rulers big doubly nationally. Doesn't matter that you shop

488
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,839
lift it in the store and you go to Queensland for holiday you still can't step into a goodies.

489
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,599
So remember another day again I'm giving you a site line knowledge of things.

490
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,439
You can do anything you want just don't get caught. So in my teaching I teach you both sites

491
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:07,879
of the point so you're aware of what you can get done for the point about cutting tiles and

492
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:13,000
everything you can do it don't do it publicly so that people see you. You can do it inside without

493
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:20,599
a breathing apparatus without water suppression or dust suppression already using water.

494
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:26,839
There's somebody don't get caught nobody cares because nobody sees you the moment you do it outdoors

495
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:33,799
in full view of the public the result is very different you walk away with the fine.

496
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,879
So for the dusting remember when you're filling out your form for your assessment tasks as well

497
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:48,039
depending on your scenario what is the scenario that you're putting as your presenting scenario.

498
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:55,000
You are doing a site extension then you may not have that much done you're doing a brand new

499
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,599
build and you're showing a job site the site the site plan you may have to put in some sort of dust

500
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:10,759
concern in this case. Next one is the one that probably the EPA is most concerned about and it

501
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:17,159
happens on a lot of our job site erosion and sediment. On the other hand this never happens on

502
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,759
sites where you're just doing small little internal renovations right it's only when it's quite

503
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:29,160
significant in terms of an extension or in concrete you know doing site works that's where things

504
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,640
so you have things such a drainage management they're giving you a suggestion of things that you can

505
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,800
right now there's nothing to tick off here there's nothing for you to kind of say right I've done

506
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,759
this I've done that you can take if you've done it you can take it so it's easier for the inspector to tell

507
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:54,119
but what it is is a list of items that suggest to you what you can implement on your job site right

508
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,759
so if you've never worked in building construction there's still no excuse because they tell you

509
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,000
exactly what you can do to prevent the following things from happening.

510
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,879
Last thing in that section there I want to highlight to you is number 19

511
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,600
vehicle and road management this this is usually the thing that we builders get done for especially when

512
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,000
you're doing site works why because a truck will drive on the site you drive off site you carries the

513
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,680
dirt down the street right so the better idea is to stand at your job site with a hose and

514
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,560
hose down the wheels high pressure community wash it down so you can just drive down the street

515
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,960
and your mess is confined just to your own your site we also tend to put wooden

516
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,319
planks on the front of the crossover to prevent cracking but also because the wooden planks have

517
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:56,200
got spaces in between them it causes the mud to fall off right other things that we tend to do as

518
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,119
builders is that on the entrance to a job site we tend to rock the site that means we buy a crush rock

519
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:10,439
40 mil 20 mil you'll pick chunky rocks so that when you drive on no mud sticks to your wheels

520
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:15,000
or to your tires so it never gets driven away now how much do you think a street

521
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,879
female will cost just team the street to the end of the street

522
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:27,879
it's a thousand dollars a point all right just to get him out there just to drive around and

523
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,440
clean up the street okay unless you're feeling awfully generous I suggest you clean the site

524
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,760
clean the machine on site before the drive on the track you know a thousand dollars to clean the

525
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:55,240
street one time cost and it'll affect your bottom line next thing waste so that a couple packs of waste

526
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,200
any spoil that you do not use so spoil I call it soil different packs of mixes of soil is called

527
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:11,000
spoil any kind of spoil that you do not use is also considered waste then it may be contaminated

528
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,880
in certain cases and of course you more to move from now most of you I don't think you'll be

529
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,759
moving the waste yourself you'll probably get excavation company and earth movement company

530
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:29,000
to do it to you they can assess the soil for you and the equipment now the main contaminants that

531
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,039
you tend to see are things such as oils so some people I don't know why they're just very

532
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,079
interested in doing that the earth garage maintenance work they will empty out the

533
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,799
engine oil from their cars and because you've got construction site in the zone you'll just

534
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,879
from really walk across the quarry into your mix well you're excavator driver because he's the one

535
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,720
dumping it you'll be aware of what you can see there now I hope you start to see why it's important

536
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,360
to have a builder that's inside all the time the moment you have umpte builder you're really trusting

537
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,559
that everyone is doing their job correctly if not what do you think this guy is going to do

538
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:15,640
next to the driveway so I dig everything up it's gonna say well there was oil he'll tell the guy at

539
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,800
the yard either we put down all the charts and credit it to my account the next time I dump some

540
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:30,200
thing take it off my account so I've seen games like that now when you move soil soil will come

541
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,160
off site it's actually it's actually a three-sheet one so you can actually blow it up get it

542
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,440
the bigger size rather than go outside but well done at least you figured out how to use the printer

543
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:53,240
yeah um moving soil outside is not free you will over time as a builder you start to realize that

544
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,679
if you're in a rush to move things off you have no choice you have to pay for the soil disposal

545
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:05,079
right alternatively I can give you an example from my own path own paths when I owner build my home

546
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,519
because I owner build my own home I have no time limit right the building permit is two years

547
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,400
I have all the time in the world I can take my own three time to build my arrangement to dump soil

548
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,719
because I need to dig up my my side is an elevated side I needed to dig out to put retaining walls

549
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:30,039
and and so called driving garage right I have all the time in the world my arrangement with the

550
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:37,960
uh uh excavation company was whenever somebody needs cleans for I'm really busy so in the end I

551
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,320
don't have to pay for disposal I need to pay the truck driver to drive back before so here again

552
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:51,960
I'm making you aware the more you need time or time is of a set of two you building is never cheap

553
00:35:51,960 --> 00:36:01,159
because you cannot wait you just need to do it at that point and depending on where you will

554
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:10,199
a lot of you had mentioned before corner of middle barrow road and uh white horse road there's a

555
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,879
shell petrol station it's just across the footy oval diagonally across the street from box to the

556
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:22,759
high when I started for my first box that was supposed to be our job site the soil is awfully

557
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:29,079
contaminated nobody wanted to process the soil the developer chickened out of it

558
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:37,719
this is now 2025 I first changed careers in 2014 10 years later now someone is doing that so it

559
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,759
tells you when it's contaminated how long it takes for them to clean up so you need to need the

560
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:49,719
site for more how do you tell when soil is contaminated kids are very simple look at what the site

561
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:56,119
was used for before and look what's next door do you know why that site is contaminated look what's

562
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:04,440
into the shell petrol station so don't forget petroleum will reach out of everything and you'll

563
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,039
find some interesting okay that petrol station has been there for ages when I first moved to the

564
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:16,599
country 2000 a petrol station was really so you can imagine for that beyond that anyone born

565
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:24,920
you seen the petrol station earlier in 2008 you remember this petrol station on the right

566
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,079
when though it's a BP or something and after I think it happened three or four years ago

567
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:38,039
before COVID I saw the petrol station shut down and then killed out a new

568
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:46,360
apartment within two years so maybe it wasn't contaminated maybe they managed to find the

569
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,639
engineer to sign up since the contaminated are they just seemed to be driven by over highway and

570
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:58,039
uh kind of a revolve on the right level so again I'm going to put it to you this way

571
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,199
there's two escaping this I'm sure all of you are aware of it we work in a very corrupted

572
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:10,759
industry there are a lot of people paying money to facilitate things right so just so you're aware

573
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,119
it may be a petrol station it may be contaminated it may not be contaminated by all the

574
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,880
requirements for somebody to sign up since we're on the computer at the moment why don't I show you

575
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:33,000
this so that everyone can see google maps I think the class is seen this but some of the new students

576
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,639
haven't so please bear with me and I hope you all understand what's going on

577
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,079
uh

578
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,079
uh

579
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,519
nope I'll be able to find it in a while just give me a second

580
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:08,199
the human being down

581
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,800
anyone ever seen this job site this is 2022 let's go back in time

582
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,360
site was sold in 2018

583
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,199
2019

584
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,400
uh is that 2019 we have a 2019 sorry there's 2021 uh to go back in time a bit more

585
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,519
2020 one November a little bit earlier and that I can't see because I've got that

586
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:55,079
I was 231319 right so you have to take my work for it all right the job site started

587
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,239
in just a year and COVID started so I think you can figure out that this is around the COVID

588
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:10,920
plan but it kind of makes you quite scared that in 2022 this was the free all right up to last year

589
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,119
the frame was still exposed

590
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,559
the color was all gray they never took down the frame they got a company called the moment

591
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,119
I can tell you guys I live very near this so I can watch this happen in real time

592
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,799
this company turned up a lot they're

593
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:41,799
so this company turned up a lot they're trapped so there and after they were there a few months later

594
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:48,440
they started planning that building now if your timber is turned gray and black you think you

595
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:56,200
should continue living in that place of building so money money solves problems you can buy your

596
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,079
way out of a situation because obviously they're over committed now if you drive fast now it's

597
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,800
completely cladded but still not done okay it's it's quite scary

598
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:14,120
thank you

599
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,760
thank you there

600
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,560
all right next thing about your waste is your disposal what is your disposal method now

601
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,080
on the one hand remember I said you're the person conducting business

602
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,360
you cannot subcontract your responsibility although you can hire someone to come in and clean it

603
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,280
why do they always write this line that says you cannot subcontract your responsibility

604
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,640
because at the end of the day if they don't take responsibility for it you have to take responsibility

605
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:54,200
so hiring the appropriate earth moving company hiring the correct waste management company

606
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:02,280
is important so if you're going to use a side beam please use someone refute the vote okay I don't have any

607
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:10,440
suggestions for you my former side beam company has one bankrupt I now use Dingo

608
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,400
right which is the same ones that you see on the block right so I don't think so I think they're

609
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:25,480
very reasonable for the work that we do okay once you are a so most of us as builders we tend to

610
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,680
order eight cube things because that decides that things are very nice things and there's enough

611
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,000
space for most things and the other thing about bingo is that they're not too

612
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:41,719
the studios in case you don't know the term for studios those of you who are Chinese will understand the

613
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:48,679
term in gym your Cantonese you're very prestigious I mean you're you need to pick everything you're

614
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:53,480
not happy with everything right everything you want it to be correct a lot of good a lot of

615
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,359
big companies are very careful because they obviously go and you draw rubbish that they cannot

616
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,079
be exposed right bingo tends to be pretty flexible they understand that it's a

617
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,440
high-end hassle of normal building you cannot fill a whole bin up with that best fault obviously

618
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,079
but if a small chunk finds its way in fact they're not going to you know read you the right

619
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:21,559
acting that sense they understand that comes just five of them you use a reputable company so

620
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,880
you know that the material will not disappear from your site and get dumped on the other side in case

621
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,519
you didn't know my own job site has been affected by site dumping it's a very difficult process to get

622
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:40,920
compensation right I'll tell you why it's difficult because in the first place on my site the

623
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,079
neighbor managed to record the person dumping but the EPA still can't take action the person that's

624
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,880
been caught for the company because of the license plate on the truck they go for claims that they

625
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,480
rented out the truck to another person the other person that was driving the truck said that he wasn't

626
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,440
the person driving the truck there was a driver on the truck in the driver no longer lives in this

627
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:12,119
country so it becomes a kind of a sequence of going backwards in terms of who gets faulted by the other

628
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,159
day I've got good news for you the EPA is going to pay for it because the owner of the truck

629
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:22,679
not finding owner of the truck not find for two reasons one is because it sees truck the best

630
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:27,399
example I can give you is that you run through a traffic light or your deck drives your car and

631
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:33,719
runs through a traffic light who gets fine you because it's your car the second thing why the owner

632
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,199
of the truck will find is because they could see that the license plate was tempered with they

633
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:45,319
changed a number one into the left a tee by drawing a blue line with a blue marker on top the license plate

634
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:53,240
so but please be aware use the right company because now the fine that are in the wear off the EPA

635
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,600
is not only going to find the company that has the truck the EPA is finding the builder that means the

636
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:10,280
job site that the material found this way off so you get fine twice so please use a reputable

637
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:17,720
company if you're going to do any kind of site clearing and site disposal now again they give you

638
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,080
advice remember the advice may not apply to you because obviously sites are different but you can

639
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:29,640
see you need a designated concrete wash up point if you have a concrete truck in the room most of

640
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,880
the time we wash it up on the site itself there's no dedicated site but what can you do you cannot

641
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:42,599
wash it out on the road okay you can't wash your concrete waste out on the road we should back

642
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:49,800
the concrete truck into your site wash up there is that your response on the internet wash the

643
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,599
stuff nope the concrete truck delivery driver will ask you where can I wash up he will do the washing

644
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:03,720
but you have to direct him onto your site there many ways of doing it you can also get a filter

645
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:09,399
back that will filter out the water from the wash up but keep your concrete inside a bed at

646
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:16,119
these large backs that you have depends on whether you prepare for it if you have an empty job site

647
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:22,199
my advice to use is to pack the truck into the site and just dispose of it it'll be good because

648
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:29,719
you know why concrete contains crushed rock the aggregate will form a surface on top of your

649
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:37,480
entrance thereby you know keeping it cleaner during times of heavy rains next one chemicals now

650
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,480
most of the time on on a construction site they are very few chemicals we don't really use much

651
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,519
the only time we use chemicals are two stages one washing of bricks so after the brick lane has been

652
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:58,039
done they tend to use hydrochloric acid but it's heavily diluted right the other thing that you

653
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:03,880
will find that you use acid because obviously acid washing your drively if you pour concrete to get

654
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,719
a certain look or a certain effect on top of it so there's very little situations where you will

655
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:16,519
have this on a lot of construction site but remember again as I said this is not only used for

656
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,599
domestic construction it's also used for commercial construction in this way

657
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:31,319
right there may be significant flora and fauna so flowers, plants, trees and the light you can always

658
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:36,519
just put the you protected those areas by putting a fence around you got tree protection zones in

659
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:43,400
place you can draw it into your fence so that big space that you see on the top is for you to draw

660
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,559
your planings let's get it down you can see shown to you there right

661
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,200
important thing in the first instance is really a site plan so you will notice that your architect

662
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,480
tends to give you a site plan right at the start or your surveil if you want just copy and plaster

663
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,519
you screenshot on a map or on a PC if you open the PDF file you can use the sticking tool

664
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,400
but what you can do then once you paste it in there is that you can now start editing in the

665
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:27,639
picture by putting in the different types of protections that you put in place right you can also

666
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:34,199
circle the affected areas so you can show that you've identified it now I want to point out something

667
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:42,119
that may sound really bad but remember this if you prepare one of this even if it's deadly prepared

668
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:49,960
you still won't get fined as badly as if you don't have one that's the way the system works here

669
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,359
in Victoria as a builder the moment something goes wrong the moment you can take out that box

670
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:03,000
of the box file all of these documents and put it in front of the inspector your fine is very

671
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,199
visible it's a very cheap fine the moment you turn up with your site in the inspect and you don't

672
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:16,039
have this and you've done something wrong the fines are messy again it goes up exponentially so

673
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:22,280
please bear that in mind so prepare before you start last one is the heritage overlay I doubt any

674
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,159
of you will be doing works on heritage overlay sites but if you did that would be another issue

675
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:34,839
so for most of us we'll be able to circle no for your assessment task my advice to you is

676
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:39,480
choose a site that doesn't have a heritage overlay and doesn't have a tree protection zone so

677
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:49,960
avoid things in White Horse okay make sure now is an actual plan so if you're wondering why there's

678
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,480
a big box on the right hand side for you this time now you have to actually show your plan so

679
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:03,079
the first page was your site plan the second page is actually you specifying what you're doing

680
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:12,440
or to mitigate all the problems okay so again you have at least there of noise dust erosion sediment

681
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,920
waste coming over again it goes through that whole process again you feeling things like the

682
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:24,199
likelihood what are the consequence and what your risks are now more often than not the overall

683
00:50:24,279 --> 00:50:29,000
risk tends to be what happens when you put high risk

684
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:42,839
sorry yes you need to start creating a proper mitigation plan you need to get an expert to write up

685
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:51,399
what needs to happen so for more often than not you try to avoid these things when will you have high

686
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:59,160
risk go to what say and look at all the high risk what involved in construction off the top of my head

687
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,840
sorry I'm not prepared to give you all the answers but one of the first things that you can think

688
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:11,559
about what is the biggest risk in construction when you dig out a basement when you dig out in close

689
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:18,680
spaces you know you're digging out those kind of things are really high risk okay so when you're

690
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:23,960
digging out things like erosion and sediment you will need to shut down the walls meaning you need to

691
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,919
block it off so that it doesn't collapse in on the person so then that would be high risk you

692
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:35,399
need to have a proper mitigation plan you mean it stays letters whatever it may be if you're digging a

693
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:44,199
really deep take if you go online and you google CFMU in YouTube sorry go to YouTube CFMU inspections

694
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:49,799
you can watch a lot of their inspection and more often than not in domestic construction these days

695
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:55,719
a lot of builders like to build low-rise apartments with basement garages and you'll notice that they're

696
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:02,679
ill prepared for it a lot of these jobsites do not have any access or ways of getting people up from

697
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:12,039
your basement up to ground level so as a result the CFMU steps in why do the CFMU step in on a

698
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:21,880
domestic site any reason somebody in the working force there is a member of the CFMU

699
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,239
so they protect their members that's the most important so look at your own jobsite

700
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,920
start to assess the risk of what there is now more often than not the only thing that you will

701
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,759
come across as a domestic builder if you're going that way are showing pools showing pools are

702
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,720
problem because they're deep enough once you fall into it once you dug out you know it's just

703
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:52,920
all soil and everything so the simplest protection is just offensive once you fence it you're done

704
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,640
that's the minimum that you need to do again remember you can do a lot more you can cover it with a

705
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:04,040
dark sheet to make sure that rain doesn't just fall in freely but then at the same time that's the

706
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,880
minimum protection that you need remember I'm only here to tell you what's the minimum you have to do

707
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,720
now you may ask me why is it you're always talking about the minimum all of these things

708
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:23,320
time because you money you need to have a balance between all of this at the end of the day of

709
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:29,480
any jobsite you'll be considered by trying to match up to the price that other builders are going

710
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:36,840
to quote your client later on somebody remind me please let's talk a little bit about pricing

711
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,880
works so that you understand what's going on so here's my first example to

712
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:51,480
how you price your job also involves your risk how you view risks and how you assess all these risks

713
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:58,200
remember you may get fined by the EPA you may get fined by what say you may get fined

714
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:06,600
by the council you may get fined pumpkin fined you look at the job and you assess your risk

715
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,519
most suburban jobs in the middle of where we are here in White House and everything as long as you're

716
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:20,360
not on the main road it should be pretty okay it's quite easy to work if you get fined in you know

717
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:27,160
a suburban area that nobody listens to God you've got to be stupid and you've got to be really unsafe

718
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:34,840
to be fined by the council members right so does it make sense to you how your PMP is okay

719
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:42,200
there are a lot of places that you can seek information from remember part of me in a picture is

720
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:49,320
teaching you how to fish I'm now making it simpler for you by giving you a whole bunch of links

721
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,440
on the side there of your for those of you sorry I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to put those

722
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,920
who still can't access your learning children that one is really not my fault that one is the

723
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,760
but for those months you get access to your learning shell you will see I've given you all the links

724
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:13,079
so unlike most teachers here what I'm trying to do also is try and take away the learning curve

725
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,480
because sometimes the hardest part about learning building or doing things is that how do I spend time

726
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,880
searching for you now you don't have to search I've provided everything for you there you can see

727
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:32,599
everything there you can read it you can download pick whichever environmental management plan

728
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:40,360
I'm not going to force you to use the case one I like the case one because I think it's simple you

729
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:46,840
find the ritual shadow one or another walker one better use biolid for him but you will find that

730
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:55,480
in your assessment task right yeah prepare a PMP implement a PMP review and so without even

731
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:02,920
coming to that week where talk about the assessment tasks I've read how do you do assessment task too

732
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,559
so this term is going to be pretty easy one of your classmates follow him up to me at the start

733
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,519
the class well this term got very few assessments it doesn't always work out this way it depends

734
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,960
on the assessment task right it wasn't written by me you just have to do it this term will be

735
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,480
pretty simple you should be done by the middle of the term right any questions

736
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,079
anyone at home with any questions am I still alive or not

737
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,280
remember inside the slide I didn't mention before I very give when you links to all the major

738
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,280
I'm sure what you do now this one obviously you can tell I copy the piece study it out of something

739
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:02,600
I give you pretty good understanding of for us here in Victoria ready the crucial thing as builders

740
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:09,240
will be big works for local council and the EPA and what see for people all right for for groups

741
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:17,960
right if you cover all of that pretty much okay in terms of your consideration

742
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:24,119
for things now there was one last part when you were talking about before we stopped last week

743
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:29,320
specific to building a construction there was a list of things right your apprenticeships your

744
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,920
people working on the job site you reducing greenhouse emissions water conservation green building

745
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,720
usage again I hope I keep reminding you of all this and your way about it still boils down to money

746
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:49,079
okay the amount time that you take your apprentice out of working cost you money because he's not working

747
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:57,879
the implementations of PPE safety measures and everything also cost you money it doesn't come

748
00:57:57,879 --> 00:58:05,000
free so you can see the level of investment builder puts him depending on his job site

749
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,519
depending on what he's got that for risk cases so again let me remind you I'm not here to tell

750
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:17,079
you not to do things but it has to be a balance you have to be conscious of the effect of what

751
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:23,559
your building is going to do right some of you are now building with different materials right some

752
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:28,519
materials are not good for the environment when you want to know what both examples for

753
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,759
for me it's a terrible material for the environment

754
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:38,519
all right using a lot of concrete is also really bad for the environment

755
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:46,280
and building for is also really bad for the environment because eventually you have to tear down

756
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:54,280
the part of the bill and redo so I don't know the balance between earning money and profiting

757
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,920
and actually building something of substance that will work that one I need to need to go through

758
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,880
the top process right last one

759
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:10,280
last week we didn't talk about it remember you're in a company and you're seeing

760
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,720
their management working above you you go to them with all the risks that you can see so just like me

761
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,519
I was quite idealistic when I first started this because obviously I thought you know I went to

762
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:26,119
master builders I did my set for my boss at the time or the carpenter at the time that I worked for

763
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,519
is a master builders member so I can do my set for free in those days right and I was taught all these

764
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:37,400
things so obviously you know being an actor that make me from that background I read everything and I go

765
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,360
well I have to do this I can do that right when I get to sight I'll start implementing all these things

766
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,119
but then you start to realize one thing when you get to sight you see your boss actually carry any

767
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:51,239
of this up and your boss will start to remind you that in the co-face of building right

768
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:59,400
it's money money comes right if you work in a much larger corporation like the Hikari Group

769
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:13,559
you know once and many all the big companies you think senior management has any idea that this is going on

770
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:19,480
they have no care so again I'm catering to those of you who you actually want to go to the

771
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:25,000
commercial construction remember nothing goes wrong until it goes wrong senior management won't get

772
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,519
involved in it if you go and sell the idea to them that does not suit how much it costs

773
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:36,519
ever the day talking to people is the best way to get it before you sign up your trip so I'm

774
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:42,280
going to talk from a residential builder perspective so you are equipped with the top courses that

775
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,880
go through my time when I start with any type of first thing the client is the one thing for the job

776
01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:55,480
I always ask them what is your level of tolerance to the site don't forget as a builder

777
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,920
you use a site page you know a site page is it means it does a cage where you can dump all your

778
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:09,159
rubbish inside it's just cage stop yeah for those of you and all it's very important that you

779
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:14,679
keep your microphone off whoever sneezes the earlier I can hear you and everyone that you

780
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:22,199
should stop bless you anyway if you put a site cage inside it's cheap to deploy but it needs to

781
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:28,919
find my agreement with my perspective of things so coming back to the cost of things today is that

782
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:34,919
I always explain to the client why my costs are the way that we are I am very risk it was I think all

783
01:01:34,919 --> 01:01:40,839
of you realize that now all right I don't like taking risks because I like to sleep well at night

784
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:45,480
I like to make sure that on Sunday afternoon the neighbor doesn't fall I like to kick things very

785
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,000
clean on my job sites so I never need to worry when I turn up all my all the neighbors are very

786
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,280
friendly with me where and I turn up I can tell you from history when I was in the

787
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,000
apprentice the neighbors even make sandwiches for me because my job site is a perfectly clean and

788
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
whenever they tell me something I have a problem learning this is happening I solve it

789
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,320
I just solve it or explain to them why things have to happen the way they do and then I apologize for

790
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:17,400
inconvenience and we don't know but again they explain to them makes it a lot easier setting the

791
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,039
making sure that they are aware so regardless of whether you're dealing with the client

792
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:26,440
dealing with the neighbors or dealing with your bosses I think there's something you think about

793
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:35,000
so that completes element one of your first units the next one you guys move on to element two

794
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:43,559
can we take a short break here say ten minutes continue with the mix up all right which will be

795
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:49,880
the diction about wrist management everyone I hope hand in a break

796
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,279
see you in about ten minutes my Microsoft team still doesn't work

797
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,599
waste thank you in

798
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:17,139
you

799
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:45,559
you

800
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,559
you

801
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,559
you

802
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,559
you

803
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,559
you

804
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:15,559
you

805
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,559
you

806
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:15,559
you

807
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,559
you

808
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,559
you

809
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,560
you

810
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,560
you

811
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,560
you

812
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,560
you

813
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,560
you

814
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,560
you

815
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,560
you

816
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,560
you

817
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,560
you

818
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,560
you

819
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,560
you

820
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,560
you

821
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,560
you

822
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,560
you

823
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,560
you

824
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,560
you

825
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,200
What kind of safety and environment?

826
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,480
But you can tell that if you screw up your preparation

827
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,640
on the top side, what kind of safety will be affected?

828
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,000
That's why you do.

829
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,760
Now, you'll recognize the fact that this

830
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,280
is your slide from your Moodle shell.

831
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,920
So for the new students, you wonder, what you're doing.

832
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,720
I think before you come to class every week,

833
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,920
it's good for you just to be back.

834
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,880
It gives you some sort of idea and sets the scene for you.

835
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:42,039
But I talk more practically about things.

836
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,800
Now, in the first part, first element of this unit,

837
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,600
you're going to talk about the facilitation

838
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,239
of identification of what health safety, risk management

839
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,319
requirements.

840
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:54,159
So you need to identify with you, identify

841
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,039
all the legislative requirements for things,

842
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:58,479
identify the beauty model.

843
01:16:58,479 --> 01:16:59,800
This is the most important bit.

844
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,439
You must obviously the box top to view as a builder.

845
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:05,960
You identify communicate roles and responsibilities

846
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,159
of individuals.

847
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:10,279
You identify your organization specific factors.

848
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:12,119
So again, you see contact in this right?

849
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:14,399
It depends on the size of your organization.

850
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:15,880
And what kind of work you're doing.

851
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,920
You can confirm that the scope is fairly defined

852
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,039
as part of your organization or procedures.

853
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:25,000
So what's risk management?

854
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,519
What?

855
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,840
Anything you do has risk.

856
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,519
Me getting on a skateboard has risked.

857
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:37,719
Everything you do, everything has risk.

858
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,199
And go with it, realize it.

859
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,720
And the other day, remember when COVID was around as well,

860
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,559
you stepping out of your house was a risk, right?

861
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,840
Because that was what you were told.

862
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,479
COVID bad, sure died.

863
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:50,880
So stepping out of your house was, you

864
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,399
choose what risk you want to choose.

865
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:57,039
So the government introduced this measure

866
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,559
where you all had to be masked in public schools.

867
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:02,239
Some people didn't do it.

868
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,479
Some people go to site as well on a building

869
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,639
and construction site.

870
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:07,920
Much a risk.

871
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,880
There are a lot of things that you kill you in construction sites.

872
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,680
Things that you breathe, the place that you start.

873
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,800
Things falling from above.

874
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,480
Materials that are inside the hazardous human life.

875
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,840
But your management of this risk depends

876
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,319
on how much information you have.

877
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:28,880
And how knowledgeable you are, how observant you are.

878
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,039
I will have seven years.

879
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,239
Now seven.

880
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,159
Just thirty seven.

881
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,359
Here is no concept of risk at this point.

882
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:38,599
The younger you are, the less information you have,

883
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:39,639
the less knowledge you have.

884
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:41,960
You're not all the others.

885
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,599
I heal you, anything.

886
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:48,559
You'll jump from any kind of stairs, anything.

887
01:18:48,559 --> 01:18:52,279
And your age, would you put your head on the desk?

888
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:55,079
You're going to have to sit your fingers in the mouth.

889
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:56,880
You wouldn't have to stand to keep your head

890
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,679
yourself as much as you can.

891
01:18:58,679 --> 01:18:59,880
Keep your touch, everything.

892
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,439
Because don't forget, as kids, you're a great tactile.

893
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:05,319
Everything is just sensation of touch.

894
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:07,719
Everything is unique.

895
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:12,000
So until you get a full understanding of all the requirements,

896
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,319
all the risks, and what preventative requirements,

897
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,799
but maybe you're more in the mindset

898
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:21,880
where until you know all the finds.

899
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:29,439
And you sit up and go, I have to sit up and sit.

900
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:31,199
And I have to do something.

901
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,599
So I was made aware from the very early stages

902
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,400
of finding quite the little things.

903
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,240
I give you a example.

904
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,200
Well, Caldwell is a side supervisor.

905
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,440
I am responsible for the people all in the world.

906
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,039
When I first started in this, remember,

907
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,760
I didn't come from this background.

908
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,880
I was a scientist before this, and I'm a P1.

909
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,560
I had a labelled, you know, on site in Caldwell.

910
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,160
And we were tasked to take down part of the wall.

911
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,800
So as a brick wall, you know how Caldwell

912
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,360
is in Leibniz Street, all the places are terraced.

913
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,360
So it's just a brick wall that's ending up

914
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,079
against the next brick wall.

915
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:10,600
I can take down the level of the brick wall

916
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,800
because the road trust, the Posit Trust,

917
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,320
was going to sit on the wall.

918
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,560
It's too high up in the air.

919
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,640
So I boss gave me the morning,

920
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,159
so I mean, you take down the wall.

921
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:24,199
You can set up some scaffolding in one.

922
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,000
There's a scaffold, there's a robot scaffold.

923
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's got quick stings.

924
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You still need a new one.

925
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,119
You can't walk down a scaffold, you can buy it.

926
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:32,640
You can buy this scaffold complex.

927
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,640
They move up and down.

928
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,319
You can just move it up and down.

929
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:36,760
You can even stand inside the wall

930
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:41,960
and then you chip away with a select hammer.

931
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,519
So I boss life after that.

932
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:45,519
I think the couple of measurements in my labra

933
01:20:45,519 --> 01:20:47,439
and my labra was keeping up with things.

934
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:49,359
I'm just easier to work with two people.

935
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:51,559
Part of the safety requirement as well, right?

936
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:52,880
In case something happens to one,

937
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,439
the other ones they can get away.

938
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:56,279
I mean, anyone can survive it.

939
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:57,039
It's really stuck.

940
01:20:57,039 --> 01:20:59,119
Usually that's why I work side-to-side

941
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:00,720
together.

942
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,519
So I say you need to take down four branches.

943
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,800
So which is scaffolding?

944
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:12,800
Stakes of one end, of the scaffolding,

945
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
I say the other end.

946
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,239
So I'm very wide scaffolding.

947
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:18,199
Careful, maybe the biggest length of people

948
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:21,239
be prepared to meet the second people there.

949
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:22,960
That's not the aim of it very much.

950
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,720
So your one on each end, you just start

951
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,199
with working as much as the cable.

952
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:28,359
You need to be able to make it go right here.

953
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,439
Get down, push.

954
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:32,880
After a while, my labra starts saying,

955
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,679
this is too slow.

956
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:35,960
Boss, this is too slow, boss.

957
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,519
I got a better idea.

958
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,719
The brick wall is a too brick wall, right?

959
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,519
So we climb up, start in the middle,

960
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:46,000
we stand on the wall, we start hitting them.

961
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I go, what?

962
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,759
That's so fast.

963
01:21:48,759 --> 01:21:50,439
So I say, OK?

964
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,679
I'm happy that I didn't consider the risk, right?

965
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,719
Why don't you be fall off the wall?

966
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,159
The wall is the least two point four meters high.

967
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:58,359
But I don't think you fall off the wall.

968
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:00,039
I think consider the risk.

969
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,559
But I'm not from this background.

970
01:22:01,559 --> 01:22:03,800
To me, I just assessed, because I've used

971
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,119
the standing on the skateboard.

972
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,079
For me, two bricks, it's a lot of space.

973
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:08,920
No problem.

974
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,840
I just stand there and let's do the second.

975
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,000
Next one.

976
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It will be right.

977
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,359
Then the bricks will drop, right?

978
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,039
That's a great idea.

979
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:19,840
The being of fine is a Mexican guy.

980
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,599
He thinks that being of no problem is good.

981
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:23,319
You do this way?

982
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:23,960
I don't think that way.

983
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,479
Because you want to check.

984
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:26,799
I want to do the back.

985
01:22:26,799 --> 01:22:28,479
The back will finish faster.

986
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:29,399
The front is harder.

987
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:30,599
So I say, OK?

988
01:22:30,599 --> 01:22:31,799
I do the front.

989
01:22:31,799 --> 01:22:33,959
So I swing the swing.

990
01:22:33,959 --> 01:22:35,759
He swings this way.

991
01:22:35,759 --> 01:22:36,959
I think it's because of the swing.

992
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:37,919
Because of the partial slope.

993
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:38,439
Yeah.

994
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:40,079
It's because of the swing type.

995
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:41,599
So he starts from the middle.

996
01:22:41,599 --> 01:22:43,359
And what about the middle?

997
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:48,319
So obviously, it's not a fast process.

998
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:49,559
Five or 10.30.

999
01:22:49,559 --> 01:22:51,879
He says, let's take your brick.

1000
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:52,879
Money key.

1001
01:22:52,879 --> 01:22:53,919
I say, OK, you take your brick.

1002
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,560
I know what.

1003
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,079
I just keep going.

1004
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:57,600
No, I don't think it comes back from money key.

1005
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,279
I've almost done.

1006
01:22:58,279 --> 01:22:59,480
I only got shots.

1007
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,880
I'll finish it off.

1008
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,960
And then we know I'm done.

1009
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,760
I got a boss to the next box.

1010
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,480
Boss one thing.

1011
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,560
Who's that thing?

1012
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,440
I got a boss.

1013
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,960
They OK.

1014
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,480
No problem.

1015
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,079
No problem.

1016
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:16,800
I think the next thing I know, I get a phone call from my boss.

1017
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,319
You're not there.

1018
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:19,159
Are you?

1019
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:20,000
No, I'm not there.

1020
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,319
He says, OK, he's carrying the thing.

1021
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:26,079
Do you realize there's a channel 7 television

1022
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:27,079
on the outside?

1023
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:29,079
What's safe is there?

1024
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:30,079
I face the end of white.

1025
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:32,319
I really don't know.

1026
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:33,679
He fell off the wall.

1027
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,559
He broke his leg in four places.

1028
01:23:36,559 --> 01:23:38,039
He's only got 2.4 meters of wall.

1029
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:39,759
But you know why he broke his leg in four places?

1030
01:23:39,759 --> 01:23:41,119
Just because I was breaking it up in the ground,

1031
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,719
what is this surface like?

1032
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,119
It's no longer a flat surface.

1033
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,679
So you don't fall and flex.

1034
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,039
You fall on the real.

1035
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:51,039
Channel 7, what's it?

1036
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,840
You know what the final is for my boss?

1037
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:00,000
Over 100,000 dollars.

1038
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,519
Not worth hiring the laborer.

1039
01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:02,600
So that is the surface.

1040
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:08,119
So my boss asked me what happened.

1041
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:09,119
He discussed it.

1042
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:10,039
He wasn't my fault.

1043
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:11,479
I'm the inexperienced one.

1044
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,840
He's the one that suggested me.

1045
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,079
I did all the way to the prime.

1046
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:15,239
I never fell off the wall.

1047
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:16,720
He fell off the wall.

1048
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,880
My broke his leg in four places.

1049
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,400
He was the best because he's a laborer.

1050
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,560
He never ever wanted to work in the first place.

1051
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,440
He got what safe compensation.

1052
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,600
And he paid a lot.

1053
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,319
He never worked the day in his life as a laborer.

1054
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:36,800
The last I heard he was running a bookstore in Turkey.

1055
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,840
So he kicked us in a holiday because that.

1056
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,000
Please, me not knowing what the regulation is.

1057
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,920
Me not knowing what is safe, what is unsavory.

1058
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,319
I couldn't make it to fall in the situation.

1059
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,000
I hope my own life experience can be something.

1060
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,479
So understanding where to find information.

1061
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,159
What information, what the consideration is.

1062
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,920
Remember, anybody that wants to build inside

1063
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,359
is your responsibility as a laborer.

1064
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:04,759
You can't get away from it.

1065
01:25:04,759 --> 01:25:07,399
Sure, they have their own risk management plans.

1066
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:08,679
They have their own streams.

1067
01:25:08,679 --> 01:25:10,000
They have everything.

1068
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,039
It's all put in place.

1069
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,159
Well, and good.

1070
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,079
By the end of the day, if anything should happen to them

1071
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,639
on the job site, you're thinking to put up your hand

1072
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,880
was it because of the latent condition on the site?

1073
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,560
Now, in time of information, we're always

1074
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,680
at this unique location.

1075
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,760
I mean, even if I send you off to work safe,

1076
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,280
I send you off to EPA.

1077
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,800
I say, we're everywhere.

1078
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,000
You have this limitation, but no two jobs site.

1079
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,600
You see, one thing that people fail to realize

1080
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,720
in this game of building is this.

1081
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,600
No two buildings were able to see.

1082
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,160
No two jobs site, you can say.

1083
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:48,079
No two sites were ever had the same conditions.

1084
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:49,079
Why?

1085
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:50,680
Because the people working on the site

1086
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,639
will go at different times of the game

1087
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,880
in your building at different times of the year.

1088
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,720
Building now, starting a building project now, it's good.

1089
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,399
I say, in January, around this time,

1090
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:04,319
the weather suits for ground works.

1091
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:06,079
Sure, we have a rain storm yesterday,

1092
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,159
but it goes back to some very, very fast.

1093
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:13,399
Try doing a site cut in August.

1094
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:15,399
Your world will be very different.

1095
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:18,399
The risks and the things that you need will be different.

1096
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:23,399
So, high-frames, the exposure of your data

1097
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:26,399
and where you're taking the data from the code

1098
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:28,399
will always skew your data.

1099
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:33,399
Even if something out of the ordinary happens,

1100
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:35,399
they'll also skew your data.

1101
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,399
Where can you get your WHS information

1102
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:41,399
from?

1103
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:43,399
If you're in the part of a much larger company,

1104
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:45,399
you have all those things at the bottom right hand

1105
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:50,399
from risk assessments, job safety, standard operating procedures,

1106
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:53,399
or needs, personnel record,

1107
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:57,399
signage, insurance record, workers compensation rate.

1108
01:26:57,399 --> 01:27:01,399
That will tell you how risky or how well produced company.

1109
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:04,399
But the company always have to tell what is all the season

1110
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,399
procedures, what the system is.

1111
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:10,399
So, if you do intend to start a daddy,

1112
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:12,399
mommy, mommy, mommy, company,

1113
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:14,399
so what should your workplace call us?

1114
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:15,399
50th.

1115
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:18,399
In your induction,

1116
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,399
you should always tell the worker,

1117
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:23,399
I have one principle outside.

1118
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:27,399
If you're not safe, do it, do not do it.

1119
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:29,399
Step away, call me.

1120
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:32,399
Here's my phone number, call me.

1121
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,399
Teams are a very good thing, right?

1122
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:39,399
Once you sign down on that, what does that do?

1123
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:44,399
It transfers all the responsibility of your shoulder increase.

1124
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:48,399
You very advise the worker from the very start in induction.

1125
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:51,399
Not safe, don't do it.

1126
01:27:57,399 --> 01:27:58,399
Remember,

1127
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:01,399
everyone wants to go home.

1128
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,399
You don't get to go home, you have an issue.

1129
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:07,399
Somebody doesn't get to go home on that day.

1130
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:10,399
You have lost your earnings, your loss of productivity,

1131
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:14,399
your loss of the company actually achieving what you want to do.

1132
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:16,399
So, something for you to think about.

1133
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:18,399
Try to finish it.

1134
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:21,399
It's a way can you find information?

1135
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:24,399
Your company may not be thinking of a South-Hand.

1136
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,399
So, your induction sheet must take place.

1137
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:30,399
Preparing a robust induction sheet

1138
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:33,399
that would tell the person working on your job site,

1139
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:37,399
what your expectations.

1140
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:41,399
Has it in the workplace you normally have a risk register,

1141
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,399
identification report, incident report,

1142
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:46,399
and your construction loves to check.

1143
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:48,399
Can I buy out of something?

1144
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,399
I don't have one.

1145
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:54,399
What needs to take the place of this again?

1146
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:56,399
Your shoes.

1147
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:58,399
Your safe work methods.

1148
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,399
You must have a safe work to help people how to do it.

1149
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:04,399
Most established contractors,

1150
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:07,399
including every subcontractor I work with,

1151
01:29:07,399 --> 01:29:09,399
has a Google Drive,

1152
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:12,399
with all of these documents.

1153
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:15,399
It's very simple for setup.

1154
01:29:15,399 --> 01:29:18,399
Once you have a list of all the normal tasks that you're going to do,

1155
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:21,399
join the industry association, download them.

1156
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:22,399
Safe work methods,

1157
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,399
pick them up for each task.

1158
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:26,399
Start a folder, call it,

1159
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:28,399
whatever the address might be.

1160
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:31,399
36 white horse rules.

1161
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:35,399
46 golden animals.

1162
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:40,399
Which I might provide, man.

1163
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:42,399
But you get my phone.

1164
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:44,399
You start a folder, you chuck all of this inside,

1165
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:46,399
you have a little bit of Google Drive.

1166
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:47,399
The moment you get all of this,

1167
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:49,399
you just show them Google Drive here.

1168
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:51,399
That's all before.

1169
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:52,399
Remember what I said.

1170
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:54,399
It's not about how well you're prepared.

1171
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:56,399
It's a question of technology.

1172
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:58,399
You have to go through it.

1173
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,399
Pass on the data that you get out of it.

1174
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:04,399
Small-time builders, like us,

1175
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,399
know data.

1176
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:07,399
Bigger companies are obviously at it.

1177
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:13,399
It is available so that you can assess what are you risky things that you are using.

1178
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:15,399
The rest of it for yourself,

1179
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:17,399
if you're doing this for yourself,

1180
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,399
is your own experience.

1181
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:21,399
Now that I can do the new fall of the world,

1182
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:23,399
I know not to trust a paper.

1183
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:25,399
The moment I am not there,

1184
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:27,399
it goes back up.

1185
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:29,399
Now if I think about it,

1186
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:32,399
yeah, he should still understand the whole thing.

1187
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:35,399
Standing on a brick,

1188
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:37,399
legs like that,

1189
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,399
two wide, you know,

1190
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:40,399
what is it?

1191
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:42,399
How wide is a brick?

1192
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,399
110.

1193
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:45,399
110.

1194
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,399
A brick cavity is 35.

1195
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:48,399
110.

1196
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:50,399
To me, it's your face.

1197
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:52,399
It's most face that it's capable.

1198
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:54,399
But to me, something happened,

1199
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:55,399
it wasn't paying attention.

1200
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:56,399
It felt it broke.

1201
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:57,399
It's four places.

1202
01:30:57,399 --> 01:30:58,399
It broke.

1203
01:30:58,399 --> 01:30:59,399
It's an ankle.

1204
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:00,399
It's an ankle.

1205
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:01,399
Me.

1206
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:02,399
Yeah.

1207
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:04,399
I can't remember what the last one was.

1208
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:05,399
Whether it was a fever or not.

1209
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:06,399
Something broke.

1210
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,399
So four places.

1211
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:14,399
Never worked today again.

1212
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,399
So where can you find information?

1213
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:19,399
First, people.

1214
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:21,399
This one is a thread.

1215
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:23,399
This one is a federal run site.

1216
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:27,399
So it has a very comprehensive database.

1217
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,399
One thing that I didn't include in that,

1218
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:33,399
because I think it's also falls under and would be what's it?

1219
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:34,399
Okay.

1220
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:35,399
So all of us,

1221
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:36,399
you know,

1222
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:41,399
different organizations that look after.

1223
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:43,399
Look after different states.

1224
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:47,399
What's wrong with you?

1225
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:50,399
My friend bought me something last week.

1226
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:52,399
I can continue teaching.

1227
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,399
You got a thank Michael for this.

1228
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:59,399
Right.

1229
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:03,399
The funny thing about Australia is that although you can do your

1230
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:06,399
qualification in any state,

1231
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:09,399
that is recognized across Australia,

1232
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:13,399
please understand the governing bodies of building of safety,

1233
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:16,399
regulation, environment,

1234
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:18,399
all different different states.

1235
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:21,399
So there's something you have to bear in mind.

1236
01:32:21,399 --> 01:32:22,399
For Victoria,

1237
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:25,399
the first and foremost authority will be safe for.

1238
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:26,399
Well, look safe.

1239
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:27,399
Right.

1240
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:29,399
And then obviously across Australia,

1241
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:30,399
you can look at safe.

1242
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:35,399
Safe work has a list of guidelines for what you need to pay attention to.

1243
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:38,399
So your state and territory will help the safety code of practice.

1244
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,399
It's your source of information.

1245
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:44,399
There are different things that you need to pay attention to.

1246
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,399
I always bring up my favorite one,

1247
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:47,399
which is working high.

1248
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:52,399
And also gives you all the data on the particular incidents on the work.

1249
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:53,399
The same for the website.

1250
01:32:53,399 --> 01:32:57,399
Tells you what to go follow.

1251
01:32:57,399 --> 01:32:59,399
Incidents alike.

1252
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:00,399
But I have something.

1253
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:03,399
And the other day all of this.

1254
01:33:03,399 --> 01:33:07,399
Can't compare to you being on site and recognizing Australia.

1255
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:10,399
Don't devalue yourself.

1256
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:11,399
If you neglect your site,

1257
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,399
you don't look at what you want to do.

1258
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:17,399
You need someone else to just go in and do what is happening there.

1259
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:18,399
It will happen.

1260
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,399
It doesn't matter what data you have.

1261
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:26,399
What information tells you you have to be there to assess the issue.

1262
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:28,399
So experience is pretty important.

1263
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:31,399
You can't get away from it.

1264
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:32,399
Now,

1265
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,399
here's where I'm going to break off the topic that I want to talk about.

1266
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:42,399
About the cost of building.

1267
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,399
These are all the stakeholders responsible for safety.

1268
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:47,399
On your job site.

1269
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:50,399
The owner.

1270
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:52,399
I know some developers in the room are looking at me.

1271
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:54,399
It's not for one of my responsibility.

1272
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:55,399
It's not people.

1273
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:56,399
It's the amount.

1274
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:59,399
Pay.

1275
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:00,399
You will turn around and go,

1276
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:01,399
how? But then if I pay them,

1277
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:02,399
among these,

1278
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:04,399
not enough, the builders should not take the job.

1279
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:05,399
In some cases,

1280
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:09,399
not all builders have their ability to step away from the job.

1281
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:10,399
If the look assess the job,

1282
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:11,399
you go right.

1283
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:12,399
Okay.

1284
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:13,399
I have no choice.

1285
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:14,399
I have no work.

1286
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:15,399
I have six staff.

1287
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:16,399
I need to pay the bills.

1288
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:18,399
I need to pay the job.

1289
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:19,399
But don't forget,

1290
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:22,399
this is something we're responsible for.

1291
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:24,399
The primary person.

1292
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:25,399
What you call.

1293
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:29,399
Person conducting business undertaking is the building.

1294
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:32,399
That's the main point of contact.

1295
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:35,399
The workers are also applied also because.

1296
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:37,399
Some contractors are there.

1297
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:40,399
Supplies are also taken over.

1298
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:46,399
What if you provide in material that doesn't require visitors,

1299
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:47,399
obviously,

1300
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:50,399
if I invite someone to come to the site to walk through

1301
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:51,399
and to assess some people,

1302
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:52,399
they're still not hired at the site.

1303
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:54,399
But he's also a safety worker.

1304
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:56,399
The worst.

1305
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,399
Is the surrounding party.

1306
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:00,399
The movie talk about the cat coming over.

1307
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:02,399
What about kids coming over?

1308
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:04,399
So they think it's fun to be inside.

1309
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:11,399
So welfare view of the job site and all your staff depends on.

1310
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:12,399
Okay.

1311
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:17,399
Look, I'm trying to this one about building.

1312
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:18,399
All of you, I guess,

1313
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:21,399
if you don't work in my industry at this point of time,

1314
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:22,399
this industry at this point of time,

1315
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,399
you must be fascinated with the numbers that are coming out.

1316
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:30,399
One thing that screwed us up the most is the house and land package ideas.

1317
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:32,399
You look at it and you went,

1318
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:33,399
wow,

1319
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:35,399
five house and land.

1320
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:38,399
I know it's far on the subway.

1321
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,399
For three hundred and ninety nine thousand.

1322
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:44,399
Two.

1323
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:45,399
In real life,

1324
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:50,399
would you sell land in a house for three hundred and ninety thousand?

1325
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:52,399
Start building the mess inside your head.

1326
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:55,399
The average house takes about nine months to build.

1327
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:57,399
I constantly sit there.

1328
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:00,399
I constantly help to that to build a house in nine months.

1329
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:05,399
But do you think a house can be built in nine months?

1330
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,399
Depends on the size of house.

1331
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:09,399
Depends on what the house features.

1332
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:14,399
How many different traits are going to be working each other?

1333
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:16,399
Now in nine months,

1334
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:18,399
that's almost a good one.

1335
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:23,399
What is the average salary for an Australian now in the year?

1336
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:29,399
Every street is going around in seven thousand.

1337
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:31,399
Put that together and hit us.

1338
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:32,399
70,000.

1339
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:34,399
You're building a house of three hundred and ninety nine thousand.

1340
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:36,399
Seven times what?

1341
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:37,399
Five.

1342
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:38,399
Six.

1343
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:40,399
Can you build a house?

1344
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:42,399
You'll say,

1345
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:47,399
oh, but not everyone's working every day.

1346
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:50,399
These are actually people salary.

1347
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:52,399
And you think you can build a house.

1348
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:54,399
And land.

1349
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,399
And material.

1350
01:36:57,399 --> 01:36:58,399
And materials.

1351
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:00,399
You got materials on that wall.

1352
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:01,399
So please.

1353
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:02,399
Start back from that.

1354
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,399
There's no way of building for those.

1355
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:08,399
Margin's have come back significantly.

1356
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,399
Just cost of this.

1357
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:14,399
I don't know who you blame for this cost of living crisis.

1358
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:16,399
I got a few people to suggest.

1359
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:19,399
Obviously supermarkets are on.

1360
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:24,399
I'm back to the worst.

1361
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:25,399
I got a shoplifting.

1362
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:27,399
I keep back in the world.

1363
01:37:27,399 --> 01:37:29,399
I'm not guarding from the.

1364
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:30,399
I'm the.

1365
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:31,399
You know, let's.

1366
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:32,399
You know, let's.

1367
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:34,399
Three times every time.

1368
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:35,399
OK.

1369
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:36,399
But you see my.

1370
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:37,399
I know I heard.

1371
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:39,399
I think the.

1372
01:37:39,399 --> 01:37:41,399
Supermarkets are in.

1373
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:45,399
I think the government is also partially responsible for this.

1374
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:49,399
We're doing a tremendous amount of infrastructure projects.

1375
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:52,399
So materials getting stuck up.

1376
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:54,399
Even labor is.

1377
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,399
If you don't.

1378
01:37:57,399 --> 01:37:59,399
If you are an experienced.

1379
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:01,399
For some sick and high.

1380
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:02,399
I'll slam it out here.

1381
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:03,399
The domestic market.

1382
01:38:03,399 --> 01:38:04,399
What are you going to do?

1383
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:06,399
No, for the.

1384
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:08,399
For much larger company.

1385
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,399
Working on the long history.

1386
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:12,399
The salary can.

1387
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:14,399
I just joined the unit.

1388
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:15,399
Of course.

1389
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:17,399
It's really not stupid.

1390
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:18,399
Imagine.

1391
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:21,399
The cost of the running.

1392
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:24,399
The amount of money that you're going to put down.

1393
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:25,399
The.

1394
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,399
The.

1395
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,399
So please don't just think that it's simple.

1396
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:34,399
We should turn around.

1397
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:35,399
1000 house and land.

1398
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:37,399
The language of a hundred thousand.

1399
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:38,399
That's about.

1400
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:40,399
Two hundred nine thousand.

1401
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:41,399
For real.

1402
01:38:41,399 --> 01:38:44,399
I think I'm a nine thousand salary.

1403
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:46,399
100 thousand for profit.

1404
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:48,399
And then the other hundred thousand.

1405
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:50,399
100 thousand.

1406
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:51,399
100 thousand anytime.

1407
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:52,399
100 thousand.

1408
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:53,399
100 thousand.

1409
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:54,399
100 thousand.

1410
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:55,399
100 thousand.

1411
01:38:55,399 --> 01:38:56,399
100 thousand.

1412
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:57,399
100 thousand.

1413
01:38:57,399 --> 01:38:58,399
100 thousand.

1414
01:38:58,399 --> 01:38:59,399
100 thousand.

1415
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:00,399
100 thousand.

1416
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,399
To do a simple.

1417
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:06,399
You recently got three coats all around the hundred thousand.

1418
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:07,399
But.

1419
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:11,399
Just to do one simple.

1420
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:12,399
Not cheap.

1421
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:13,399
So 100 thousand.

1422
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:14,399
The bill.

1423
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:16,399
They used to be three hundred.

1424
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:17,399
100 thousand.

1425
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:18,399
How's the land package?

1426
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:19,399
I'm sorry.

1427
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:23,399
That should have saved me.

1428
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:25,399
Cost of labor is not phenomenal.

1429
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:28,399
When I started in this industry, remember my labor.

1430
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:29,399
Gabino.

1431
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:35,399
His economy was 150 dollars a day in cash.

1432
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:38,399
How much does the skill labor.

1433
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:42,399
Guys as well as one two twice.

1434
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:47,399
I was a cash.

1435
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:48,399
Time is move.

1436
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:49,399
I'm sorry.

1437
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:53,399
So if you plan to try and think about this doing this cause.

1438
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:55,399
When you come in and I'm traveling.

1439
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:57,399
You'll find a number of people.

1440
01:39:57,399 --> 01:39:58,399
They were neighbors.

1441
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,399
They need to struggle before.

1442
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:03,399
Now.

1443
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:06,399
Your main responsibility is that they are a daily lives.

1444
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:08,399
Person conducting business.

1445
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:11,399
So this is an example of what you do.

1446
01:40:11,399 --> 01:40:13,399
Once you sign the contract is you.

1447
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:16,399
You need to provide safe premises.

1448
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:18,399
Safe machinery and with you.

1449
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:19,399
Safe systems of work.

1450
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:21,399
Any quick information.

1451
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:23,399
Instruction training and supervision.

1452
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:26,399
And also work within suitable working environment.

1453
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:27,399
Silicon.

1454
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:29,399
How is home to sleep?

1455
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:32,399
How about outside of normal working hours.

1456
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:34,399
Some of you are asking the question.

1457
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:35,399
Remember we have a perfect unit.

1458
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:37,399
Why can't we do it on Saturday?

1459
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:40,399
This is considered unsociable hour.

1460
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:43,399
And you all want to know why before teaching on Saturdays.

1461
01:40:43,399 --> 01:40:46,399
I did say that because I remember the course with running on Saturdays.

1462
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:47,399
You know before I run.

1463
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:49,399
But why do I like teaching on Saturdays?

1464
01:40:49,399 --> 01:40:51,399
Because it's considered unsociable hours.

1465
01:40:51,399 --> 01:40:54,399
The school case between 25 and 7 months.

1466
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:57,399
So one hour counts at 1.25 hours.

1467
01:40:57,399 --> 01:40:59,399
Every four hours I get the trial of it.

1468
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:01,399
See then.

1469
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:02,399
I saw it.

1470
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:04,399
I was just social.

1471
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:08,399
If you get your workers to work outside the normal working hours.

1472
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:11,399
You can talk about seven in six.

1473
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,399
You have to pay more.

1474
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:14,399
You sure?

1475
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:16,399
This is working unsociable hours.

1476
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:19,399
Do we actually pay more?

1477
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,399
Who usually works in the time?

1478
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:24,399
From six PM to midnight or six PM to the next morning.

1479
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:28,399
I can tell you my team.

1480
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:31,399
So you're now for me.

1481
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:32,399
You understand me?

1482
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:33,399
Give me the keys.

1483
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:34,399
Don't worry more.

1484
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:36,399
Is it present?

1485
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:44,399
Yes, please.

1486
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:48,399
That's his belief system.

1487
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,399
In the day time he has spent the day with his son.

1488
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,399
And he's got a pretty good system.

1489
01:41:55,399 --> 01:41:57,399
But not all trips are working out.

1490
01:41:57,399 --> 01:41:59,399
You go completely up and you walk in the night.

1491
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:01,399
So he's in different situations.

1492
01:42:01,399 --> 01:42:04,399
Required different methods.

1493
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:08,399
How you make sure that you save looks like everyone.

1494
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:10,399
Is to understand your job.

1495
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,399
So again, I'm going to come back to this point that constantly.

1496
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:16,399
Don't try and rush this.

1497
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:19,399
If you don't understand what you're doing.

1498
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,399
A lot of trouble.

1499
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:25,399
Because you don't understand what risks are involved with the various people.

1500
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:27,399
Well, various.

1501
01:42:27,399 --> 01:42:29,399
Now, this one is a little bit boring.

1502
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:32,399
It's all your legislation kind of shit.

1503
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,399
You will eventually figure this out.

1504
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:36,399
We are building acts.

1505
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:38,399
There are wrecks that help out with the flow.

1506
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:39,399
The act.

1507
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:40,399
Obviously, it's a standard.

1508
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:43,399
We put the practice and use it in the industry.

1509
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:49,399
So industry group such as the HIN, the NBA, the upper three Australia.

1510
01:42:49,399 --> 01:42:52,399
There are a lot of small little groups.

1511
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:53,399
There are farmers association.

1512
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:55,399
They also have the public practice.

1513
01:42:55,399 --> 01:42:58,399
They will have a list of things that will tell you.

1514
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:01,399
These are the big ones.

1515
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:04,399
The idea is that.

1516
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:07,399
The government has got bodies that run things.

1517
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:11,399
For example, within the state of Victoria, the VBA runs construction.

1518
01:43:11,399 --> 01:43:13,399
Fortunately, they do a good job.

1519
01:43:13,399 --> 01:43:14,399
So they're getting further.

1520
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:16,399
There will be a new one that will start up.

1521
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:18,399
But.

1522
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:19,399
What's the thing?

1523
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:21,399
It also under works.

1524
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:23,399
There's a federal one.

1525
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:26,399
So one thing about Australia, the YouTube.

1526
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:28,399
Australia, you to be aware of it.

1527
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:31,399
Although we seem like one country, you are quite different.

1528
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:33,399
Across all the areas.

1529
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:35,399
But you also have that.

1530
01:43:35,399 --> 01:43:39,399
The X and Rags that I told you within your state.

1531
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:42,399
You can go and read the X and Rags from another state.

1532
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:44,399
Submit your work from another state.

1533
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:45,399
I'm going to be checking.

1534
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:46,399
So hopefully you don't.

1535
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:52,399
Make sure it's all for the central.

1536
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,399
So.

1537
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:55,399
This is a concept that you need to understand.

1538
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:57,399
The same duty holder.

1539
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,399
So who is the duty holder?

1540
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,399
The first one is the PCD.

1541
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:05,399
If I hire someone, for example, I.

1542
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:08,399
I.

1543
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,399
He is now an office holder.

1544
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:14,399
He represents me.

1545
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:17,399
So remember, I'm a site supervisor before.

1546
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:20,399
I represent my boss.

1547
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,399
If my name is on the board, the news is a point that me.

1548
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:25,399
I'm not really a person.

1549
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:28,399
It's a meaning that I get more responsibility.

1550
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:32,399
If more things happen on the job site, any safety thing happens on the job site.

1551
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:33,399
Who gets fine.

1552
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:36,399
My boss has every right to charge me for it.

1553
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:38,399
Because you're being paid.

1554
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:40,399
The eventually falls back there.

1555
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:41,399
If I don't pay the fine.

1556
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:43,399
Or I don't recognize the fine.

1557
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:44,399
And I want to fight it.

1558
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:46,399
Who pays the fine.

1559
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:49,399
Hopefully you see that sense of you.

1560
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:52,399
You can't push away your responsibility.

1561
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:55,399
You can delegate the responsibility.

1562
01:44:55,399 --> 01:44:58,399
So understand the difference.

1563
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:00,399
Responsibility is still yours.

1564
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:04,399
Delegating with someone in your authority to act with your partner.

1565
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,399
So don't randomly agree to your name.

1566
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,399
For those of you who are eventually going to try and become owner of this.

1567
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,399
Remember, if you take all of the items on the board,

1568
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:21,399
you can use the safety officer to use the recognize first aid.

1569
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:23,399
The more you put yourself down for.

1570
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:28,399
I'm very happy to give you a job contractor or the builder.

1571
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:31,399
The more I start putting my name down on various things.

1572
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:33,399
Let's say.

1573
01:45:33,399 --> 01:45:37,399
Sites you provide the who to contact in case of emergency.

1574
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:41,399
It's me whether or not I'm a designated builder.

1575
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:43,399
Now the duty officer.

1576
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:45,399
I'm responsible for.

1577
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:48,399
Remember my first theory in building.

1578
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:51,399
You do not pay anyone to explore responsibility.

1579
01:45:51,399 --> 01:45:57,399
You need to be.

1580
01:45:57,399 --> 01:46:02,399
Some points more than one person can call the current issue.

1581
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:05,399
So in case you're worried about your builder,

1582
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:07,399
which you got a site supervisor.

1583
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:09,399
You're worried about it.

1584
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:11,399
You can always put a dash.

1585
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:12,399
What is this thing called?

1586
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:15,399
You put the village name.

1587
01:46:15,399 --> 01:46:18,399
There's a share.

1588
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:22,399
If you're the only person there and that's your duty,

1589
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:26,399
your safety officer, your section supervisor.

1590
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:32,399
And how do you do it for that person?

1591
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:34,399
Now.

1592
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:36,399
Now that you know who is responsible,

1593
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:41,399
the person never is responsible for what you do.

1594
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:46,399
You're responsible for identify all the hazards of the world.

1595
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:48,399
You know, says the risk.

1596
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:53,399
Identifying hazards depends on how much your knowledge of building is and what you can.

1597
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:54,399
You can see.

1598
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:59,399
Remember, I don't know whether you guys mentioned this last week.

1599
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:03,399
Most of the time I always tell people when people ask me should I try and become a builder.

1600
01:47:03,399 --> 01:47:04,399
I'm not a builder.

1601
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:06,399
I used to be a bank manager.

1602
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:07,399
I used to be this.

1603
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:09,399
I used to be that out of you builder.

1604
01:47:09,399 --> 01:47:12,399
You need three things to become a builder.

1605
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:14,399
I'm going to be very harsh with the first thing.

1606
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:16,399
The first thing is you're going to be a residential builder.

1607
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:18,399
You want to have a TV with Bill.

1608
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:19,399
You need money.

1609
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:20,399
I'm sorry.

1610
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:22,399
You don't always talk about it.

1611
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:24,399
It's a very sensitive topic for a lot of you.

1612
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:29,399
But without money, you're not going to be able to do it.

1613
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:30,399
It's a slash funny.

1614
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:31,399
You know what?

1615
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:32,399
It's a scratch.

1616
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:34,399
Money that you can randomly just dip your hands and do.

1617
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:36,399
I'm different from you guys.

1618
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:39,399
I think you know I'm very risk of us.

1619
01:47:39,399 --> 01:47:41,399
So before my wife took this conscious decision,

1620
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:46,399
she said, I don't think we need to university system go and do this.

1621
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:47,399
The first thing she said, don't worry.

1622
01:47:47,399 --> 01:47:49,399
I can bang all of it.

1623
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:50,399
I put enough money aside.

1624
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:53,399
I'm going to.

1625
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:56,399
She checked with my former boss.

1626
01:47:56,399 --> 01:47:57,399
And he's dead.

1627
01:47:57,399 --> 01:47:59,399
And they figured out what a good amount is.

1628
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:00,399
You have to have a slash funny.

1629
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:02,399
They have money to do.

1630
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:05,399
If you're always fighting against it or you're mortgaging your current home.

1631
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:07,399
You go and do it.

1632
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:08,399
There.

1633
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:11,399
The first thing.

1634
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:16,399
The second very key importance to you as a builder.

1635
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:18,399
Observation.

1636
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:21,399
If from the time you were a child,

1637
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:22,399
your friends all call you.

1638
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:24,399
You lost in space.

1639
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:25,399
The new you.

1640
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:26,399
The stress out is.

1641
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:30,399
If you are described, there are all those things.

1642
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,399
You need to be able to walk into a job site.

1643
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:35,399
Straight away.

1644
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:39,399
You need to assess what your problem is.

1645
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:43,399
I don't expect you to be able to read a plan and be able to assess your problem.

1646
01:48:43,399 --> 01:48:45,399
You need to be physically dead.

1647
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:49,399
Need to take time to walk around the section.

1648
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:50,399
Identify.

1649
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,399
The third thing I'll tell you is this.

1650
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:58,399
Whether you like it or not.

1651
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:00,399
This one is a race sensitive topic.

1652
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:07,399
If you're physically not equipped.

1653
01:49:07,399 --> 01:49:08,399
Try it.

1654
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:09,399
You're more harsh.

1655
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:13,399
If you're fat, overweight, out of shape.

1656
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:16,399
It's a very painful.

1657
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:18,399
I think I said this morning, right?

1658
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:20,399
I fell off my skateboard last week.

1659
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:23,399
I fell off on a Sunday.

1660
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:25,399
I will be able to.

1661
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:29,399
Your physique makes it very important for you to be able to.

1662
01:49:29,399 --> 01:49:33,399
If you are the sought, your frequently false sick,

1663
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:37,399
little bit of this that you are able to take it.

1664
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:41,399
You are able to sit treatment for it.

1665
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:44,399
You'll find that you're very compromised.

1666
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:47,399
In terms of the things you want to do.

1667
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:52,399
So, the identification of things, your observations,

1668
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:56,399
your ability to understand where the risk is coming from,

1669
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:59,399
your ability to understand what's going on.

1670
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:02,399
I'm going to even go once that further.

1671
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:05,399
When you review this, do not review it from your perspective.

1672
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:08,399
It means what you think is risky.

1673
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:12,399
You should try and put yourself into the shoes of the apprentice.

1674
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:14,399
17 year old boy just left school.

1675
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:17,399
Maybe physically fit, but not that bright.

1676
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:21,399
You need to assess risk from that perspective.

1677
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:25,399
That they are the ones going to be.

1678
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:31,399
When you review the effectiveness of any kind of risk control that you implement, consult them.

1679
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:34,399
That's why you have different options.

1680
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:37,399
That's why you have a safe of my test statement.

1681
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:40,399
That will allow you to question that.

1682
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:43,399
You can say, are you comfortable getting up?

1683
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:47,399
Remember the example I give you about me standing on a two brick ledge.

1684
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:49,399
The laborer suggested it.

1685
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:52,399
I'm not supposed to take his seat.

1686
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:55,399
I look at the situation.

1687
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:58,399
It's safe.

1688
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:02,399
I didn't consider what would actually be my problem.

1689
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:06,399
The first thing you do is this.

1690
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:09,399
You stand on a wall and you are going to a shop.

1691
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:11,399
From what do you do?

1692
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:15,399
You first program your brain.

1693
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:16,399
Never that way.

1694
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:18,399
You do this a few times.

1695
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:21,399
Your body naturally trains itself.

1696
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:27,399
When you are used to skate like me, the first time you stand on a skateboard, you must learn how to fall.

1697
01:51:27,399 --> 01:51:29,399
You don't learn to skate.

1698
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:34,399
You learn how to fall, say, people, then you learn to skate.

1699
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:36,399
So, same thing with the skate.

1700
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,399
My Chinese switch market is happening.

1701
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:53,399
Is there an excuse?

1702
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:55,399
Concentrate.

1703
01:51:55,399 --> 01:51:58,399
You can't do shit.

1704
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:00,399
Oh, hey.

1705
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:08,399
I'm better, mate.

1706
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:09,399
Bless my unit.

1707
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:10,399
Boxes over there.

1708
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:15,399
So, when you're at your spot and youvt, would you mind getting through all the perspective of the work of

1709
01:52:15,399 --> 01:52:18,000
from the perspective of the worker.

1710
01:52:20,119 --> 01:52:22,199
Not from yourself, right?

1711
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,759
Now, everyone know what PPS?

1712
01:52:24,759 --> 01:52:28,839
PPS, personal protective equipment.

1713
01:52:28,839 --> 01:52:33,839
Examples, logos, laws, IBIS, hoops, helmet.

1714
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,399
When you implement a risk control,

1715
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:40,799
and this, what is the requirement?

1716
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,639
You need to supply it.

1717
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:47,720
If you want them to wear it, you supply it.

1718
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,720
Right?

1719
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,400
When can you choose not to supply

1720
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,560
and make it their responsibility?

1721
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,720
I'm not sure.

1722
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,800
In the subcontractor, yeah.

1723
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,240
When can you not supply

1724
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,079
and make it their responsibility?

1725
01:52:59,079 --> 01:53:00,280
Make it their responsibility?

1726
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,119
Very simply.

1727
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,520
You write it into your school of works.

1728
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,720
All of what's a carry out safely with the required equipment.

1729
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,440
You see why now building can be cheap,

1730
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,520
why building can be expensive?

1731
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,040
The more required you put on the people,

1732
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,360
the more expensive the job is.

1733
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,960
You don't worry, you don't keep being

1734
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:24,480
no safety on side, who cares?

1735
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,800
Mr. Do the job.

1736
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,120
It's always cheaper in the past.

1737
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:30,240
You take away these things of the world.

1738
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:33,640
Why don't you start running a bigger company

1739
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,880
and you decide do things like what health safety

1740
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:39,160
consultations trust you as a builder

1741
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,800
in the domestic market, you have no time to grow.

1742
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,360
You only have one of the true people.

1743
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:45,159
First, they build them on site.

1744
01:53:45,159 --> 01:53:47,559
We capture them at that moment.

1745
01:53:47,559 --> 01:53:50,359
We hope them to walk your safety procedures.

1746
01:53:50,359 --> 01:53:52,559
Where you assemble what to do in the picture,

1747
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:55,079
you're dislying inside your people and exist.

1748
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:57,439
Do not do anything to yourself.

1749
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:01,439
Consult first before carrying a carry out.

1750
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,439
You can actually be sure.

1751
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,399
Back to the ball in the corner.

1752
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:07,239
Very quick.

1753
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,079
Go on.

1754
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:10,039
If the subcontractor comes into the job site,

1755
01:54:10,039 --> 01:54:14,159
does something, is there their own responsibility

1756
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:15,640
or is your responsibility?

1757
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,039
There are what is their responsibility?

1758
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:21,119
The site is your responsibility.

1759
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,760
If they don't behave appropriately,

1760
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,640
you're not staying safe, you're not pregnant safe,

1761
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,680
you're not keeping it on account.

1762
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,519
Is your responsibility?

1763
01:54:29,519 --> 01:54:33,399
If the chip is cut the finger with a panel saw,

1764
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:35,399
it's not your responsibility.

1765
01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:37,680
There's an accident.

1766
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,680
Your chip, your qualified chip,

1767
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:42,400
there should be no reason I have to stand there

1768
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,720
and continue to go there.

1769
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,920
Well, if you go out for a chip, it's not a good example.

1770
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,200
If someone like, I don't know,

1771
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,720
cab in the tree, that doesn't require fuller qualifications.

1772
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:54,960
And that's when you write the deal.

1773
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,600
That's when you write it if you're spoken with it.

1774
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:59,039
They take all safety precautions.

1775
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:03,039
You were to provide a safe site.

1776
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:05,920
So unless you can see, look, there's no way for me to cut.

1777
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:07,280
The site's a mess.

1778
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:09,279
That's why I'm the captain of the team.

1779
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,000
In the site is clean, the site is well maintained.

1780
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,920
You're not spaced the fact they can set up

1781
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,479
and work bench safely.

1782
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:17,479
It's no longer the first place.

1783
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:18,880
See the difference?

1784
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,199
The point is that you must make sure

1785
01:55:20,199 --> 01:55:21,920
you provide them that safe site.

1786
01:55:25,719 --> 01:55:28,000
So who are the responsible staff?

1787
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,199
Everyone that you know.

1788
01:55:30,519 --> 01:55:33,639
Everyone that does have some sort of experience,

1789
01:55:33,639 --> 01:55:36,119
enables them to be able to tell whether it's safe

1790
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:37,119
or not.

1791
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:42,079
That's why I said when you plan your safe work method statement,

1792
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:44,439
you should always consult with people.

1793
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:46,960
There's no point in getting a safe work method statement

1794
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,399
written by yourself.

1795
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:51,640
You have no appreciation of the point.

1796
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,640
The worker that's actually carrying out the work

1797
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,439
we have, we can left shoulder.

1798
01:55:57,439 --> 01:55:58,880
They got a lift to this left hand.

1799
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,640
Something has to be written into the string to cater for them.

1800
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:06,160
So writing a generic one doesn't work.

1801
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,079
It's always good to have a generic one though,

1802
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:10,880
because remember in case you get all of it,

1803
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,360
that you have a generic one,

1804
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:17,520
the subcontractor that works for you has own shoes.

1805
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,400
Both of you come together at the point you go for one.

1806
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,560
But without it, you get the same.

1807
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:26,480
Other people that can help you understand

1808
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,320
what are the work health safety requirements

1809
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:32,079
will include the designers of the job, the engineers.

1810
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:33,680
Although as you can tell these days,

1811
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:37,680
I think there's a lot of them trying to pull off as much.

1812
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:41,239
Chemistry is using chemicals and intelligence.

1813
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,640
All of them can form up some sort of advisory panel

1814
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,359
that will help you.

1815
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:49,720
But essentially all stakeholders,

1816
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,519
including you as the person productive

1817
01:56:51,519 --> 01:56:53,960
and as a person, has to be responsible.

1818
01:56:56,039 --> 01:56:58,079
Now, why if it's if you're on the other side of the coin?

1819
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:00,079
Now imagine yourself as the staff.

1820
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:03,119
So now you're welcome.

1821
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:07,079
You're responsible for your own care health.

1822
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:11,319
Take reasonable care that your ex or mission

1823
01:57:11,319 --> 01:57:15,199
do not affect the health safety requirements.

1824
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:18,519
Confide with reasonable instruction of business.

1825
01:57:18,519 --> 01:57:20,039
You know what I mean?

1826
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:22,199
Don't you be so willing to be here to comply?

1827
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:24,279
So now you see how important that first thing

1828
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:26,399
when your reduction works.

1829
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:29,719
If you feel unsafe, do not carry out your work.

1830
01:57:31,559 --> 01:57:34,000
Because that's my reasonable instruction.

1831
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,119
Is it a reasonable instruction for me to tell you that?

1832
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,119
You will work on my side.

1833
01:57:38,119 --> 01:57:39,920
You don't feel safe, please don't do the task.

1834
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,439
Tell me if I'm telling you about it.

1835
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:43,000
We'll get your thoughts to tell you.

1836
01:57:45,319 --> 01:57:47,920
But cooperate with all of the work health safety

1837
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,319
related policies and procedures of my company.

1838
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:52,799
What I said something.

1839
01:57:52,799 --> 01:57:53,920
So just now the question,

1840
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,879
somebody cuts his hand on the side.

1841
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:56,720
Is it my fault?

1842
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,560
It's not my fault.

1843
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,520
I've told you.

1844
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,960
And because your boss has brought you on the side,

1845
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,440
we should take a reasonable care.

1846
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,760
And I assume that your boss has hired someone

1847
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,279
who is a qualified.

1848
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,279
So there's no way out of this.

1849
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,000
What I mean is you have to carry out good work health safety.

1850
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,880
My personal thing is induction.

1851
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:29,920
Because you can never catch a one outside of those times.

1852
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,880
We can't be on site every day.

1853
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:34,399
Now, I say that I'm practicing builder.

1854
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:36,000
I'm exactly on the other day.

1855
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,760
But I can't be there throughout the nine hours.

1856
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,600
I will go off somewhere else.

1857
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,960
I may see something else.

1858
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,680
I might go on rather.

1859
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:46,840
So there's no better time than induction.

1860
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,119
They want, when you hire a tree,

1861
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,720
and that person turns up,

1862
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:52,880
you sit them down,

1863
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,319
you get them to sign your induction.

1864
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,199
That's the best way.

1865
01:58:58,199 --> 01:58:59,760
Now, on your hand,

1866
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,519
if you're a part of a bigger company,

1867
01:59:02,519 --> 01:59:05,720
you may need to have a WHS 15-thing.

1868
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,039
You may need to send official points,

1869
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:11,479
or count anything that needs to be put into the money.

1870
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:13,800
You may have served in emergency warning system,

1871
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:16,000
you may have served with communication treatment.

1872
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,720
All that is in the case of bigger companies.

1873
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:21,280
I want to tell you for a practical standpoint,

1874
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:24,039
is a residential, daddy, mommy, builder.

1875
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:26,680
There's no other time, day one.

1876
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:29,199
There's a need.

1877
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,159
Because you don't know when people are coming back to do it.

1878
01:59:31,159 --> 01:59:32,800
You only can do it on that first day.

1879
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,640
You have no other opportunity.

1880
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,440
You say, I don't worry about it.

1881
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,280
Let me say, come here.

1882
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:38,880
Come here, you should.

1883
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:39,720
You'll be there.

1884
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,720
You may not be there.

1885
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:42,720
You will forget.

1886
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,760
It's best day one.

1887
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,800
You use them on site.

1888
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,640
Let's see.

1889
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:46,640
We'll be there.

1890
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,320
We create action rights.

1891
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,640
We send out official announcements.

1892
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,039
Those are ways that you guys identify and keep us sent out.

1893
01:59:55,039 --> 01:59:58,720
So you will be able to see who you have to send to.

1894
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,079
What do you think?

1895
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:03,240
Now, I'm very simple methodology.

1896
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:04,600
Once I inform,

1897
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:10,039
subcontractor owner, whoever their business owner is,

1898
02:00:10,039 --> 02:00:13,720
say a hire of Jim's, from Jim's house and juice.

1899
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,920
I say email to Jim.

1900
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:17,840
I'm saying inform all of us out at the college.

1901
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:22,199
And it's your responsibility because you are now my office worker.

1902
02:00:22,199 --> 02:00:24,600
I'm paying a group, it's with subcontractor.

1903
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:27,039
You are seeing yourself, you inform yourself, right?

1904
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,680
If they all come on the site,

1905
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,680
or one go, and they come up to them,

1906
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,960
all at one go, and they come up to them.

1907
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,680
All at one go, and they come up to the site.

1908
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:41,279
Remember, the site is almost like a site in your life.

1909
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:47,159
You have to be pretty conscious of the fact that it's either them or me.

1910
02:00:47,159 --> 02:00:50,559
I'm sorry, it sounds bad, but it's really either them.

1911
02:00:50,559 --> 02:00:52,960
It's better than trying to push off to respond to.

1912
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,479
Whenever you're doing any jobs, remember,

1913
02:00:56,479 --> 02:00:59,319
the best person who knows what has it for present

1914
02:00:59,319 --> 02:01:01,599
are the people who do the jobs.

1915
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:04,479
There's no point in you trying to identify has it.

1916
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:06,079
And that's not true.

1917
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:07,079
Okay?

1918
02:01:07,079 --> 02:01:08,079
There's to do.

1919
02:01:09,079 --> 02:01:11,199
Now, if you're part of a big organization,

1920
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:13,199
not many of you have this or a student,

1921
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,479
you've never been responsible.

1922
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:18,800
The people, you have to demonstrate more comfortable.

1923
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,079
But the authority is delegated.

1924
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:24,479
So, remember, I said, build up,

1925
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:27,840
I delegate responsibility to the site.

1926
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:33,439
But my accountability doesn't disappear.

1927
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:36,319
I'm still comfortable with how I do it.

1928
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:37,399
But here.

1929
02:01:39,239 --> 02:01:40,239
Now,

1930
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,199
not all the time in your job,

1931
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:47,079
can you just suck for a bit?

1932
02:01:47,079 --> 02:01:48,719
Now, what if you're one main building company,

1933
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,399
or two main company, or three main companies,

1934
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:52,559
that's very, very popular business.

1935
02:01:52,559 --> 02:01:54,840
Most customers start up,

1936
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,519
one company, two or 26.

1937
02:01:56,519 --> 02:01:57,359
Great, right?

1938
02:01:57,359 --> 02:01:59,159
How much does a friend discuss you sign in last week?

1939
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:01,000
$16,000 out of.

1940
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,599
Great labor, right?

1941
02:02:02,599 --> 02:02:06,279
What else are you going to find labor that will work for you for $16?

1942
02:02:07,239 --> 02:02:09,719
Don't hire you on a friend business.

1943
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:12,199
You know how attractive a friend is as a,

1944
02:02:12,199 --> 02:02:15,079
so much so that our department constantly get asked

1945
02:02:15,079 --> 02:02:19,800
by builders who are not company does, right?

1946
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,800
Whether we have a friend business for them.

1947
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,960
You know what people are looking for?

1948
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,199
They're looking for cheap labor.

1949
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,759
What a mess they can.

1950
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,359
But the decision of whether you can do all of this,

1951
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:33,159
whether you have one health care plan

1952
02:02:33,159 --> 02:02:36,199
that will give you the most important number one,

1953
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:37,960
the finances.

1954
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,119
You know, you know, finances,

1955
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:42,479
you have no time to sit down and talk to people,

1956
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:44,840
tell them to just want you to go far.

1957
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,680
Any moment.

1958
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:02,639
I wouldn't give you a very simple example.

1959
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,760
Let's say you want to own a build a house.

1960
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,760
And you have a high need as a satin manager.

1961
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:12,000
If my name is not on the board,

1962
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,160
can I ask you for a lot of money?

1963
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,720
I'm not thinking of your responsibility.

1964
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,560
Anything?

1965
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,240
Once my name goes on the board,

1966
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,320
once I'm responsible for something,

1967
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:25,560
I need to think of responsibility for it.

1968
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,039
I can't get away from it.

1969
02:03:28,039 --> 02:03:29,320
Maybe it's my mentality of thinking,

1970
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:30,680
I think you could tell from this morning

1971
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,119
or it was all right, you exchange with George.

1972
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:35,240
I mean, teacher, I think responsibility for him.

1973
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:38,360
The school pays me, I know what my student is doing.

1974
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,400
And any one time,

1975
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:43,039
you need the current batch of 20, 25, 1.

1976
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:44,680
I don't know you all by your first names

1977
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:46,400
and last names.

1978
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,720
Nearly everyone else in this class of the day.

1979
02:03:51,079 --> 02:03:52,240
That's my responsibility.

1980
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:53,600
I've been paid for it.

1981
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:56,720
Same responsibility, you find yourself in a job.

1982
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,520
The more responsibility you give someone,

1983
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,280
make sure you're paying for it.

1984
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,720
There's no free lunch.

1985
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,720
Else I go, even one better thing to do.

1986
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,320
If you want safety on site,

1987
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:14,920
and nothing you do, watch a little question,

1988
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:17,159
are you giving the staff enough time

1989
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:19,720
to carry out the safety aspect of the job?

1990
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:24,320
You do realize cleaning up as part of safety.

1991
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,800
You leave everything as a mess.

1992
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,720
It's not a very simple problem.

1993
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:33,119
Proposal, if you don't get them enough time,

1994
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:34,560
you think they're gonna be looking at the site.

1995
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,360
So what is your priority for the job site?

1996
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,960
I'll give you a simple example of my couple of jobs.

1997
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,280
All them turn up, go to the 7.30,

1998
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,159
trust me, I look at their trucks and everything.

1999
02:04:45,159 --> 02:04:47,560
They start working 7.30.

2000
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,720
They finish three a clock.

2001
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,640
From three to three, 30, they have to free.

2002
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:55,079
They have to pack all in at 30 minutes.

2003
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:57,520
But if you don't give them enough time,

2004
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,680
then no, no, no, you keep going until 3.30.

2005
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,680
I want work done until 3.30.

2006
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,560
Not fair, you think they're in good place.

2007
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,520
So that's why I said, come back to this, right?

2008
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,400
The financial aspect of it.

2009
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,600
The reason why job sites are in safety,

2010
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,160
because we're stretching ourselves

2011
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:14,520
and doing more than we possibly can,

2012
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:17,520
we'll accept what is our maximum level of doing work.

2013
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,240
How equipment?

2014
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:21,680
For those of you who work in building,

2015
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:25,560
or you can imagine working when you're at 35.

2016
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,160
Often you get service,

2017
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:31,039
often you check, there's actually working correctly

2018
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:33,280
on your electrical items or tag.

2019
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,600
And they will check.

2020
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,160
I'm sorry, this again,

2021
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:42,760
look for answers, can't pay for it in tag.

2022
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,360
Normally, you can pay for experts to come in

2023
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,960
and tell you what to do, give you information

2024
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:52,120
or what to provide you a background check.

2025
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:54,119
Right?

2026
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,119
Access to other information.

2027
02:05:57,119 --> 02:05:58,599
I want to point out something.

2028
02:05:58,599 --> 02:06:00,680
Until today, the Australian standards is a free.

2029
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:04,000
It's a big debate going on in case you don't know

2030
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,359
in the background, there are a lot of people

2031
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:06,640
very angry about this.

2032
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:08,760
How do you expect builders to build

2033
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:11,559
the Australian standards if the Australian standards

2034
02:06:11,559 --> 02:06:14,039
are not truly accessible?

2035
02:06:16,119 --> 02:06:17,960
The government has an answer for you by the way.

2036
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,119
We make safe free.

2037
02:06:20,119 --> 02:06:21,119
Go sign up for it.

2038
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:23,119
We have free access to that.

2039
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:26,119
You can go to the Victorian library.

2040
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:30,119
No one is in city.

2041
02:06:30,119 --> 02:06:32,119
No, but central.

2042
02:06:32,119 --> 02:06:33,119
You can access the Victoria's there.

2043
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,119
I mean, those trains there.

2044
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:35,119
They love you.

2045
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:37,119
A people are lazy, they want everything.

2046
02:06:38,119 --> 02:06:40,119
So the government has to be making a second.

2047
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:42,119
Please understand.

2048
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,119
That's informal.

2049
02:06:44,119 --> 02:06:46,119
Anything to do with what health safety

2050
02:06:46,119 --> 02:06:47,119
or deployment of it,

2051
02:06:48,119 --> 02:06:49,119
you have to be financially driven.

2052
02:06:50,119 --> 02:06:51,119
There's no way out.

2053
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:55,119
This one is going to be a taxi conversation

2054
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:56,119
with all of you.

2055
02:06:56,119 --> 02:06:58,119
You now are looking to join an industry

2056
02:06:58,119 --> 02:07:01,119
that is one of the most culturally diverse

2057
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:04,119
and also the demographic is very, very wide.

2058
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:09,119
The people that you meet on the side.

2059
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:12,119
I want to say something very hard.

2060
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:14,119
On a normal day, they won't be afraid.

2061
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:18,119
You will never cross them with any shape size

2062
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:20,119
or form in your daily life.

2063
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:22,119
But this is the industry.

2064
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:24,119
In this industry,

2065
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:25,119
it's not like any other.

2066
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:29,119
If I see you working for one of the big four

2067
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:30,119
or computer phones,

2068
02:07:30,119 --> 02:07:31,119
everyone's big university.

2069
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:37,119
Everyone probably is a second generation

2070
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:39,119
at university graduate.

2071
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:41,119
It's done well in life.

2072
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:43,119
A lot of other things are called

2073
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,119
the kind of parents probably will take them

2074
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:46,119
for overseas holidays.

2075
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:48,119
In our industry,

2076
02:07:48,119 --> 02:07:50,119
a background that diversity is ridiculously large.

2077
02:07:53,119 --> 02:07:56,119
More often they're not because of the physicality

2078
02:07:56,119 --> 02:07:58,119
of the work that we do as dealers

2079
02:07:58,119 --> 02:08:00,119
or what we need to do on the job site.

2080
02:08:00,119 --> 02:08:03,119
A lot of people who have no school smarts

2081
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,119
have ended up down this far.

2082
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:07,119
Most of the time in the rest of the week,

2083
02:08:07,119 --> 02:08:09,119
society is at this point.

2084
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:10,119
The moment people flank out of school

2085
02:08:10,119 --> 02:08:11,119
where they go to pay them.

2086
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:14,119
Every time talk them to them.

2087
02:08:14,119 --> 02:08:15,119
I always have this problem.

2088
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:16,119
I talk them to them.

2089
02:08:16,119 --> 02:08:18,119
I see parents coming and go to my son.

2090
02:08:20,119 --> 02:08:21,119
He's not doing too well in school.

2091
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:22,119
He's thinking of something of truth.

2092
02:08:22,119 --> 02:08:24,119
I get really irritated with it.

2093
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:26,119
Because at the same time,

2094
02:08:26,119 --> 02:08:28,119
have you ever wondered if you've got an

2095
02:08:28,119 --> 02:08:29,119
easy carpenter,

2096
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:31,119
how life would be difficult for the rest of us as well on site?

2097
02:08:33,119 --> 02:08:35,119
What do you mean he's not doing well in school?

2098
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:38,119
You can take it.

2099
02:08:38,119 --> 02:08:39,119
I mean easier.

2100
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:42,119
If you're a cricket player,

2101
02:08:42,119 --> 02:08:43,119
the train has a carpenter,

2102
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:44,119
you can life easier.

2103
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,119
Still, you still have a bunch of books to read.

2104
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:50,119
It may be presented simply in here.

2105
02:08:50,119 --> 02:08:51,119
Much more simpler task.

2106
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:54,119
You don't have to deal with a computer all the time.

2107
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:57,119
But still, there's a lot of thought that goes into it.

2108
02:08:58,119 --> 02:08:59,119
If you don't put enough thought into it,

2109
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:02,119
and you haven't developed yourself enough by the time you finish

2110
02:09:02,119 --> 02:09:04,119
your train of preparation,

2111
02:09:04,119 --> 02:09:06,119
you come up with a lot of work to do.

2112
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:09,119
Remember, inside this industry,

2113
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:12,119
you have control and background diversity.

2114
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,119
You have gender issues for you.

2115
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:19,119
A lot of builders are very enticing here on a job site.

2116
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:23,119
You have already thought the seniors,

2117
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:26,119
you know, inside your contracts and we go for a certain set of

2118
02:09:26,119 --> 02:09:28,119
industry standards, which you have paid that you paid.

2119
02:09:28,119 --> 02:09:33,119
Once your workforce is more than 40% or 30% you know,

2120
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:36,119
you need very catered female market.

2121
02:09:36,119 --> 02:09:37,119
Change your roof.

2122
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:40,119
We provide them with facilities inside.

2123
02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:46,119
But we just change, obviously, the seam is your labor market.

2124
02:09:46,119 --> 02:09:52,119
Never before in the history of Australia have so many people

2125
02:09:52,119 --> 02:09:54,119
wanted to become new to this.

2126
02:09:55,119 --> 02:09:56,119
Never.

2127
02:09:57,119 --> 02:10:01,119
If you spoke to your friends back in wherever you come from,

2128
02:10:01,119 --> 02:10:04,119
and you told them that you wanted to go there to look at you,

2129
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,119
tablecl nose which is the best interacted class.

2130
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:10,119
Where does the workplace?

2131
02:10:10,119 --> 02:10:12,119
Culture.

2132
02:10:12,119 --> 02:10:14,119
Physical work.

2133
02:10:15,119 --> 02:10:17,119
It is so much risk overall on it, but yeah,

2134
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:19,119
the most popular thing,

2135
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:22,119
overnight you became the most popular brain costs in Australia.

2136
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:28,119
Laval of language literacy and numeracy skills in your workforce

2137
02:10:28,119 --> 02:10:31,119
was also varied so remember to keep things simple inside

2138
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:33,119
Anyway, simple things you will tell that safety is paramount.

2139
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:36,699
Where is what do you think your people are?

2140
02:10:36,699 --> 02:10:38,880
First thought, you think.

2141
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,140
Say, what is the worst thing that you think?

2142
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:46,039
Doesn't mean that much right away.

2143
02:10:46,039 --> 02:10:49,239
But you need to explain to them the people that are not

2144
02:10:49,239 --> 02:10:51,880
really moving the tree.

2145
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,399
How you say, you look for structure, your shift

2146
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:58,039
rosters, wherever you're working, traveling.

2147
02:10:58,039 --> 02:11:00,840
For you as a resident of England,

2148
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:03,079
how does geographical location come into the thing?

2149
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:06,359
Once upon a time, when I was a site supervisor

2150
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:09,399
in my previous life, my boss was a apprentice,

2151
02:11:09,399 --> 02:11:10,760
fell asleep in the middle.

2152
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,720
Where was the job site?

2153
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:13,279
Mount Martha.

2154
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:14,680
Where do all of us live?

2155
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:17,800
Don't cast a damn post-tort.

2156
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:20,720
Imagine driving from Don't cast a damn post-tort

2157
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:22,680
to get to jobs like the seven-year.

2158
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:26,119
What time do you think you have to leave the house?

2159
02:11:26,119 --> 02:11:28,960
545.

2160
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,920
And as a young boy, what do you think?

2161
02:11:31,239 --> 02:11:32,239
I'm going to say that.

2162
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:34,279
You have to be careful.

2163
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:35,800
So what you fell asleep in the wheel,

2164
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:39,720
a whole car crash, a whole car was told to me

2165
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:40,560
broken elbow.

2166
02:11:43,079 --> 02:11:46,199
So remember when you choose your geographical location,

2167
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:48,399
how you set up for the job is important.

2168
02:11:48,399 --> 02:11:50,199
A lot of builders don't care these days.

2169
02:11:50,199 --> 02:11:52,119
How are your senior friends in its past,

2170
02:11:52,119 --> 02:11:54,279
you form, build a list and carry out

2171
02:11:54,279 --> 02:11:56,520
and you scream, you jump site, don't cast things.

2172
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,680
Let's see a builder.

2173
02:11:57,680 --> 02:11:59,560
We'll see any of them.

2174
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:01,360
The workers want all the help.

2175
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,800
To choose people appropriately.

2176
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:06,200
If you're workers like that, you've got

2177
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:09,280
language skills, literacy skills, lacking.

2178
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:14,920
Support with need to help you look after that.

2179
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:18,360
Now, also on your jobsite, set the right example.

2180
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:22,000
Don't start introducing fun Fridays, bringing

2181
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,200
the scratch of year together with the stats

2182
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:27,120
of bad precedents.

2183
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:28,600
If there's something to celebrate,

2184
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,000
everyone off-site.

2185
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:37,160
And don't be tolerant of anyone using drugs.

2186
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,120
It can get very messy for you.

2187
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:45,280
1.6 confirmed that risk management scope

2188
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,160
is clearly defined according to your organizational policy

2189
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,120
and procedure.

2190
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:51,360
Again, I want to draw back to the same thing I keep saying,

2191
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,920
I'm sorry, it's sometimes what I record.

2192
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,039
And here, it depends on the size of your business

2193
02:12:56,039 --> 02:12:58,160
and the visibility of your business.

2194
02:12:58,159 --> 02:13:02,720
The more visibility you have, the more money you have to throw at it.

2195
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:05,840
To make sure that all of these things are capable.

2196
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,920
They're proper governments, proper understanding

2197
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:11,920
of what your staff are capable of.

2198
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,519
So you can demarcate people.

2199
02:13:14,519 --> 02:13:16,479
You know that you work for commercial builder,

2200
02:13:16,479 --> 02:13:19,519
like those that build the sky to request in the

2201
02:13:19,519 --> 02:13:21,119
epoxel central.

2202
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,840
They're different grades of capital terms,

2203
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,720
capable of being different.

2204
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:27,680
Because they need to be taken for certain things.

2205
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,560
Certain people will work at a certain level to do certain things.

2206
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:34,440
Other people can do high level work.

2207
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:37,200
They'll be brought out to be super good.

2208
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,800
It's not being discriminatory,

2209
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:44,320
protecting the business, ensuring that they are considered

2210
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:47,320
not going to be in a position of risk.

2211
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,880
And the day external context and internal context,

2212
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:55,680
obviously I just thought about internal context.

2213
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,920
It was going to be a little bit of a internal context.

2214
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,400
It was on what perception you want to be required,

2215
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:03,320
what perception you want to be society around you.

2216
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,520
Remember the other things that will affect you

2217
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,560
are obviously how the government plan these systems.

2218
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:10,520
At this point, how often do you see what's

2219
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,360
they working to do exactly?

2220
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:14,159
It's a matter of.

2221
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:15,240
But they do.

2222
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:18,520
If they do that, that's when your problems actually go.

2223
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:22,079
So you are in your head, your majoring, your business.

2224
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:25,600
I already said from the money, your own perspective,

2225
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:28,239
that the simplest thing is induction for you.

2226
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:31,399
Make that sign of everything else can be discussed.

2227
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:34,559
Keep a template of all your streams,

2228
02:14:34,559 --> 02:14:37,239
all your safety documents in one folder.

2229
02:14:37,239 --> 02:14:40,559
That covers your data.

2230
02:14:40,559 --> 02:14:43,079
It shows that you made a template.

2231
02:14:43,079 --> 02:14:44,880
Time.

2232
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,159
Simple, you don't forget that these humans are in 40 hour.

2233
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:50,519
They're not supposed to go into too much detail.

2234
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,800
It's supposed to introduce you to a concept.

2235
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,640
Are we paying for lunch?

2236
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:56,280
You can take the bricks for lunch now.

2237
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,720
And then we can come back and start the next week, 24.

2238
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:01,600
Because next week we are online.

2239
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:05,120
How much time do you spend in an hour?

2240
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:06,120
I remember.

2241
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:07,560
You're the one that asks for hours.

2242
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:10,720
So I'd mark you already as the one that wants an hour

2243
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:11,520
for lunch.

2244
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,960
I usually watch shop lunches that I like to go with.

2245
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:16,280
How?

2246
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:18,040
1 hour?

2247
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:20,160
Anyone need 1 hour?

2248
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:21,079
You need 1 hour, OK.

2249
02:15:21,079 --> 02:15:23,599
So 1 hour, it's OK.

2250
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:24,680
We're coming back here.

2251
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:25,800
So I'll be 30 back here.

2252
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:26,800
Yes.

2253
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:27,319
Same room?

2254
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:28,079
Same room.

2255
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:28,760
I'll be here.

2256
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:29,599
I'm not going anywhere.

2257
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,340
OK.

2258
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:41,840
I mean.

2259
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,380
Do you want to take a sit?

2260
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:44,380
Yeah.

2261
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:51,340
Yeah, probably.

2262
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:54,239
Oh.

2263
02:15:54,239 --> 02:16:01,239
You want to take a seat?

2264
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:10,199
been

2265
02:16:10,199 --> 02:16:28,939
Are you sure he wants to say�0?

2266
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:00,940
Who is shooting this thing?

2267
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:02,940
This is me, the single you extend up.

2268
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:06,940
What about the face?

2269
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,940
No underground.

2270
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:10,940
Oh, okay.

2271
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:14,940
So you can put this one in the paper.

2272
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:16,940
Yes.

2273
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:22,940
Is this one known?

2274
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:26,940
Require you to have the 10% sound quality.

2275
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:28,940
No, I can do it.

2276
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:30,940
Yes, no.

2277
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:34,940
No. And what about those?

2278
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:44,940
He said I don't have to answer all of them.

2279
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:46,940
I only have to answer them.

2280
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,940
That was the most important thing.

2281
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,940
Okay.

2282
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:52,940
What is this?

2283
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:54,940
What is the entrance?

2284
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:56,940
Yes.

2285
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:58,940
Yes.

2286
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:02,940
You should be able to do it.

2287
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,940
Yes.

2288
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,940
You should be able to do it.

2289
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,940
Yes.

2290
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:10,940
If you want to own it.

2291
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:26,940
You can do it.

2292
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:56,940
Thank you.

2293
